AROUND 10 A.M., THREE INDIVIDUALS IN ONE OF THE OUTLYING COMMUNITIES REPORTED A GASOLINE ODOR IN THEIR WATER. AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, LOCAL CITIZENS WERE ADVISED TO NOT DRINK THE WATER. THIS INFORMATION WAS COMMUNICATED BY LOCAL TELEVISIONAND RADIO STATIONS. CHEVRON ARRANGED THE DELIVERY OF BOTTLED WATER TO MINERAL WEELLS AND ASSISTED THE CITY IN DISPENSING IT TO AREA CITIZENS. SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR DELIVERIES TO NURSING HOMES AND TO PEOPLE CONFINED TO THEIR HOMES. WATER WAS ALSO SET ASIDE FOR THE DELIVERY TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE BOTTLED WATER UNTIL CHEVRON AND THE CITY OF MINERAL WELLS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ARE ASSURED THE WATER SUPPLY IS SAFE TODRINK. CHEVRON SENT WATER SAMPLES COLLECTED SUNDAY TO A FORT WORTH LABORATORY FOR CHROMATOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS OF THESE ANALYSES SHOWED LESS THAN 1 PPM GASOLINE. ADDITIONAL TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS. CHEVRON CONTINUES AROUND-THE-CLOCK MONITORING FOR THE PRESENCE OF GASOLINE AT THE CITY'S WATER TREATMENT PLANT AND THE LEAK SITE. CHEVRON IS ALSO PROVIDING PERSONNELWITH RADIO-EQUIPPED TRUCKS TO ASSIST THE MINERAL WELLS WATER DEPARTMENT. CHEVRON IS ALSO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE CITY IN A COOPERATIVE EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE CITY OF MINERAL WELLS LAST  NIGHT, MARCH 2, 1987, STARTED AN EXTENSIVE TREATMENT PROCESS ON ADVICE OF THEIR NEWLY HIRED CONSULTANT, AID CONSULTING ENGINEERS, INC. OF DALLAS, TEXAS. THE PROCESS WILL ESTABLISH A BASE LINE EVALUATION OF THE TOTAL WATER SYSTEM BY COMPREHENSIVE SAMPLING. ACTIVATED CARBON(CHARCOAL) WAS ADDED AT THE WET WELL WHICH TAKES SUCTION FROM PALO PINTO CREEK, THE MAJOR SOURCE OF THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY. CHARCOAL WAS ALSO ADDED AT THE WEIRS IN THE MAIN WATER TREATMENT PLANT. THE CHARCOAL REMOVES IMPURITIES FROM THE WATER, AROMATICS IN PARTICULAR. THE CONSULTANT ALSO ADVISED THAT THE WATER SYSTEM BE FLUSHED, AFTER THE CHARCOAL IS IN PLACE, BY OPENING FIRE HYDRANDS AT THE MOST DISTANT POINTS FROM THE MAIN TREATMENT PLANT. PROGRESS WILL BE MEASURED BY ADDITIONAL SAMPLING. AT MIDNIGHT SUNDAY, MARCH 2, 1987, THE CITY PUT INTO OPERATION ITS AUXILIARY WATER TREATMENT FACILITY WHICH UTILIZES WATER FROM MINERAL WELLS LAKE NEARBY. THIS SYSTEM, HOWEVER, IS ONLY CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THETOTAL CITY WATER USAGE. TOLERANCE LIMITS OBTAINED BY THE CITY FROM THE TEXAS DEP"

(POINT OF INTERSECTION) ORBEND IN THE PIPE.  THIS P.I. IS USED TO ALLOW THE 12"" TO CROSS THE 8"" LINE.  THE ORGINAL SURVEY CREW MARKED THE 8"" LINE BUT THE MARKERS HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY FARMING EQUIPMENT.  THE 8"" LINE IS SHOWN ON THE CONTRACTOR'S DRAWINGS BUT THE TRACK HOE OPERATORS HAD OVERLOOKED THE EXISTING LINE WHEN THEY BEGAN DIGGING.  THE FIRST TRACK-HOE JUST SCRAPED THE 8"" PIPE WITHOUT PUNCTURING IT BUT THE SECOND TRACK-HOE DID PUNCTURE THE LINE.  AFTER THE LINE WAS PUNCTURED, BOTH OPERATORS JUMPED FROM THEIR TRACK-HOES AND RAN AWAY FROM THE LEAK SITE.  ALSO LEAVING THE SITEWERE TWO HELPERS, C.E.NEWBERRY AND LUTHER JONES.  WHEN THE MAN WERE APPROXIMATELY 100 YARDS FROM THE LEAK, THE VAPOR CLOUD WAS IGNITED.  SOMETHING ON ONE OF THE TRACK-HOES PROBABLY IGNITED THE VAOPRS BECAUSE THE TRACK-HOES' ENGINES WERE STILL RUNNING.  BOTH TRACK-HOES AND ONE PICKUP WERE DESTROYED BY THE FIRE.  VERL ROBERTS, ONE OF THE KOCH EMPLOYEES IN THE AREA, CALLED THE KOCH OPERATION HEADQUARTERS TO REOPRT THE LEAK  AND PROCEEDED TO CLOSE THE VALVES UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE LEAK."

THE LINE WAS SHUTDOWN.INITIAL EXCAVATION OF A BELL HOLE WAS STARTED TO ASSESS WHETHER A TEMPORARY REPAIR COULD BE MADE OR PERMAENT REPAIRS WOULD BE REQUIRED.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A TEMPORARY REPAIR COULD NOT BE MADE.  THE PLAN WASTO PURGE THE PIPELINE WITH NITROGEN INJECTED BEHIND A 4 CUP SWAB AT MP 193.634 AND DISPLACE TO THE BLOCK VALVE AT MP 182.570 ( APPROXIMATELY A 10-MILE SECTION).  THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED,NITROGEN ORDERED AND PREPARATIONS OF THE LINE WERE STARTED FOR THE DISPLACEMENT.  THE BACKHOE OPERTOR WAS TO EXCAVATE AND EXPOSE THE LINE EASTERLY AND WESTERLY TO A POINT WHERE THE NEW PIPE COULD BE WELDED INTO THE EXISTING PIPELINE.  THE BACKHOE OPERATOR STARTED, APPROXIMATELY 26 FEET EASTOF THE LEAK, DOUBLE DITCHING ALONG THE LINE EXPOSING 55 FEET OF PIPE. THE OPERATOR THEN MOVED THE BACKHOE TO A POINT APPROXIMATELY 33 FEET WEST OF THE LEAK TO DUPLICATE THE PIPELINE EXPOSURE AND STRIPPING.

SHORTLY AFTER IGNITION, THE FIRE WAS LIMITED TO THE LEAK AREA APPROX. 30 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE FIRE WAS MONITORED AND ALLOWED TO BURN AND WHEN THE SWAB AND NITROGEN WHICH HAD BEEN INJECTED PASED THE LEAK SITE, THE FIRE IMMEDIATELY SUBSIDED. THE LPG SATURATED SOIL WAS ALLOWED TO BURN SEVERAL HOURS TO ENSURE ELIMINATION OF ALL LPG VAPORS IN THE AREA AND THE POTENTIAL OF A FLASHBACK.

THE RIVER WAS IN FLOOD STAGE AT THE TIME AND WAS CARRYING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DEBRIS (LARGE TREES, ETC.).  THE COMBINATION OF DEBRIS AND STRONG RIVER CURRENTS CAUSED THE PIPE TO OVERLOAD AND ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN FRACTURE OF AN ADJACENT GIRTH WELD, RELEASING 2653 BBLS OF X-GRADE INTO THE RIVER.  DISPATCHING INITIALLY RESPONDED BY SENDING A TECHNICIAN TO OKLAHOMA CITY TO INVESTIGATE A SUSPECTED METERING EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION.  HOWEVER, FURTHER INVESTIGATION INDICATED A LINE FAILURE HAD OCCURRED AND AT 23:05 HOURS THE LINE WAS SHUT DOWN AND CREWS WERE DISPATCHED TO LOCATE AND ISOLATE THE LEAK.  THE DELAYED DETECTION OF THE LEAK RESULTED FROM THE FAILURE OF DISPATCH OPERATORS TO PROPERLY REVIEW LINE OPERATING PARAMETERS.  DISCIPLINARY DISMISSALS AND SUSPENSIONS WERE MADE AS APPROPRIATE.  RECOVERY BOOMS WERE EMPLOYED AT SEVERAL DOWN-STREAM LOCATIONS; HOWEVER, THE TURBULENT FLOOD WATER CONDITIONS DISPERSED THE RELEASED PRODUCT TO THE EXTENT THAT NO RESIDUAL PRODUCT WAS DETECTED.  STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICIALS WERE ON SITE DURNG THE RECOVERY EFFORTS AND DOWN-STREAM MUNICIPALITIES WERE NOTIFIED AS APPROPRIATE.  A METALLURGICAL REPORT INDICATED THAT THE FAILED WELD (INSTALLED IN 1946) DID NOT MEET THE CURRENT API 1104 STANDARD.  A NEW 160 FOOT PIPE SPOOL WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR THE LINE.

THE CLEANUP WAS COMPLETE BY 1600 HRS ON 2/16/90 WHICH INCLUDED PICKING UP OIL WITH VACUUM TRUCKS AND THE REMAINDER WAS TURNED INTO THE SOIL AND COVERED WITH DRY SOIL.  THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY A RUPTURE IN THE BODY OF THE PIPE CAUSED BY CORROSION AT THE TOP OR 12:00 O'CLOCK POSITION.  THIS CORROSION POSSIBLY RESULTED FROM COATING DAMAGE WHICH MAY HAVE OCCURRED WHEN A CROSSING PIPELINE WAS LAID ABOUT 1981.  THIS LINE (4"" PVC), PERPENDICULAR TO THE 18"", WAS LAID ABOUT 1 FOOT ABOVE AND 2 FEET OVER FROM THE CENTER OF THE RUPTURED AREA.

AT THAT TIME, EXXON BEGAN SHUTTING IN PRODUCTION PLATFORMS AND CHECKING SYSTEMS IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING TO DETERMINE IF AN EXXON FACILITY WAS THE SOURCE OF THE SPILL.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT TEXACO MAY HAVE ALSO REPORTED A SIGHTING.  TEXACO AND EXXON COORDINATED INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE SPILL SOURCE AND MOBILIZATION OF SPILL CLEANUP EQUIPMENT.  AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, THE SEAS WERE 3-5 FEET, WITH THE WINDS FROM THE  NORTH AT 10-15 MPH AND A SOUTHERLY CURRENT.  THE RAINBOW SHEEN COVERED AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES BY 5 MILES AND WAS MOVING TO THE SOUTH.  ON THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 9, 1990, TEXACOINFORMED EXXON THAT A DAMAGED SUBSEA ONE-INCH VALVE ON AN OUT-OF-SERVICE EXXON PIPELINE WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE SPILL.  EXXON CONTACTED THE MMS AND USCG AND ADVIXED THEM OF THIS INFORMATION ON THE SAME DAY.  THIS PIPELINE (MMS PIPELINE SEGMENT NO. 4030) ORGINATES AT EXXON'S EUGENE ISLAND BLOCK314 ""B"" PLATFORM AND TERMINATES AT A SUBSEA TIE-IN TO A EUGENE ISLAND PIPELINE SYSTEM.  THE ONE-INCH VALVE WAS LOCATED AT THE SUBSEA TIE-IN AND WAS TO BEUSED DURING THE INSTALLATION OF SEGMENT 4030 TO PRESSURE TEST THE SUBSEA COMPONENTS AND DURING ABANDONMENT FOR RELIEVING PRESSURE BETWEEN THE BLOCK VALVEAND CHECK VALVE.  EXXON HAS NOT PRODUCED OIL THROUGH THIS PIPELINE SINCE OCTOBER, 1988, AT WHICH TIME THE PIPELINE WAS FLUSHED WITH INHIBITED SEAWATER AND AN EIGHT-INCH SUBSEA BLOCK VALVE WAS CLOSED ON EXXON'S LINE NEAR THE TIE-IN.  FOLLOWING THE DAMAGE TO THIS ONE-INCH VALVE, CRUDE OIL APPARENTLY FLOWED THROUGH AN OPEN VALVE OWNED BY AND LOCATED ON THE EUGENE ISLAND PIPELINE SYSTEMINTO THE TIE-IN SPOOL AND OUT OF THE HOLE CAUSED BY THE BREAKING OFF OF THEONE-INCH VALVE.  DIVERS RECOVERED THE DAMAGED ONE-INCH VALVE.  THE SOURCE OFDAMAGED TO THE VALVE REMAINS UNKNOWN, ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY SUBSTANTIAL EXTERNAL FORCE WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BREAK OF THE VALVE FROM THE PIPELINE.  PIPELINE 4030 HAS BEEN SINCE DISCONNECTED FROM THE SUBSEA TIE-IN &  BLIND FLANGES ARE BEING INSTALLED.  ON MAY 14, 1990, EXXON  CONTACTED THE NRC FOR THE PURPOSE OF UPDATING REPORT NO. 20677.  THE NRC ADVISED THAT THE UPDATE SHOULD BE CALLED TO THE USCG, MORGAN CITY MSO WHICH WAS DONE ON MAY 15,1990.

JAYHAWK PERSONNEL WERE ALTERTED AT 0300 HOURS, AUGUST 28, 1990.  THE AREA SUPERVISOR WAS THE FIRST EMPLOYEE AT THE SITE AND FOUND CRUDE OIL SPILLING FROM AN OVERFILLED TANK.  ALL INCOMING CRUDE AT THIS LOCATION WAS DIVERTED OR STOPPED BY 0340.  STATION PUMPS WERE STARTED AT 0400 AND OIL WAS PUMPED DOWNSTREAM IN ORDER TO LOWER THE CRUDE LEVEL IN THE TANK.  THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF CRUDE OIL SPILLED WAS CONTAINED INSIDE THE TANK DIKE.  AN ESTIMATED 110 BARRELSOF CRUDE WAS ABSORBED BY THE SOIL WITH THE REMAINING 860 BARRELS BEING RECOVERED.  THE OILY DIRT FROM INSIDE THE TANK DIKE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED.  HOOKER STATION OPERATES IN A FLOATING MODE, RECEIVING AND DELIVERING OIL SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGH THE TANK.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, JAYHAWK WAS EXPERIENCING A PARTIAL COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE OF ITS SUPERVISORY CONTROL SYSTEM THAT PREVENTED THE DISPATCHER FROM MONITORING CONDITIONS AT HOOKER STATION DIRECTLYAND CONTRIBUTED TO A MISINTERPRETATION OF DATA BEING RECEIVED  FROM THE DOWNSTREAM STATION LOCATION.  THE PROBLEM WAS ULTIMATELY TRACED TO UNSTABLE SIGNAL LEVELS CAUSED BY A FAULTY TELEPHONE CIRCUIT LEASED FROM SOUTHWESTERN BELL."

HERE IS A SUMMARY OF EVENTS:  CONSISTENT WITH APL'S ON-GOING EFFORT TO ELIMINATE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS FROM IDLE LINES, APL DECIDED TO PURGE ITS #2 CRUDE SYSTEM BETWEEN LAPLATA AND FREEMAN, MISSOURI, WITH NITROGEN AND DECOMMISSION IT.  APL CONTRACTED WITH UCISCO, A NITROGEN SERVICE COMPANY, TO SUPPLY NITROGEN FOR THE CRUDE OIL OUT OF THE LINE INTO A TANK AT FREEMAN.  UCISCO'S TWO NITROGEN TRUCKS WERE CONNECTED TO THE PIPELINE, AND THE PUMPING OF NITROGEN INTO THE PIPELINE COMMENCED ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1990, ATABOUT 13:20 AND CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.  LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, ONE OF THE NITROGEN TRUCKS BEGAN DEVELOPING OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS AND, SHORTLYAFTER 18:00 HAD TO BE SHUT DOWN BY UCISCO.  AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, PRESSUREMEASUREMENT DEVICES INDICATED A PRESSURE DROP WHICH WAS LOGICALLY ASSOCIATEDWITH A REDUCTION IN PUMPING CAPACITY.  THE REMAINING PUMP TRUCK CONTINUED OPERATING AND THE TANK AT FREEMAN CONTINUED RECEIVING OIL FROM THE LINE AT A REDUCED RATE.  THE DISABLED PUMP TRUCK WAS REPAIRED AND PUT BACK ON LINE ABOUT 19:00.  THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE AT THE LOCATION OF THE NITROGEN TRUCKS UP UNTIL THE SHUT DOWN OF THE FIRST TRUCK WAS 570 PSI.  AFTER SHUT DOWN OF THE FIRST TRUCK PRESSURE DROPPED BELOW 300 PSI. FOLLOWING THE RETURN OF THE SECOND PUMP TRUCK, PRESSURE STAYED LOW LONGER THAN EXPECTED, WHICH APPEARED TO INDICATE THE LINE WAS AGAIN BEING PACKED.  COMMUNICATIONS WITH APL'S TULSA CONTROL CENTER WERE HEIGHTENED IN A EFFORT TO MORE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE REASONS WHY PURGE LINE PRESSURE WAS FAILING TO RETURN TO PRE-SHUTDOWN LEVELS.  FLOW RATE AND PRESSURE INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED FROM THE TULSA CONTROL CENTER AT APPROXIMATELY 20:00.  APL WAS IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THIS DATA WHEN A CALL WAS RECEIVED AT 20:15 FROM A THIRD PARTY, NOTIFYING APL OF A POSSIBLE LEAK.  APL IMMEDIATELY DIRECTED THE CESSATION OF NITORGEN PUMPING, AND AT ABOUT 20:20.  APL PERSONNEL LEFT LAPLATA TO LOCATE THE SUSPECTED LEAK.  APL PERSONNEL ARRIVED IN ELMER, CONFIRMED THE ODOR, BUT COULD FIND NO LEAK.  AT ABOUT 21:30, AFTER SEARCHING THE AREA, APL PERSONNEL ACTUALLY FOUND THE LEAK NEAR ETHEL INA FARM FIELD 1/2 MILE AWAY FROM THE NEAREST ROAD.  APL PERSONNEL PROCEEDED TO ANSPACH JUNCTION TO CLOSE THE NEAREST UPSTREAM VALVE.  THE ACTUAL CAUSE OF THIS PIPE FAILURE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  THE ACTUAL TIME OF RUPTURE IS NOT KNOWN, BUT IS BELEIVED TO HAVE BEEN BETWEEN 18:00 AND 20:00, NOVEMBER 5, 1990."

SHORTLYTHEREAFTER IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE TANK WOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AND INSPECTED.  BY 1628 HOURS OIL HAD BEGUN TO LEAK FROM THE TANK INTO THE TANK VAULT, BUT OPERATIONS PERSONNEL HAD ALREADY CONSTRUCTED DIKES AND BEGAN PICKING UP THE LEAKAGE WITH A VACUUM TRUCK.  THE LEAK FIRST APPEARED FLOWING INTO THECONCRETE VAULT FORM THE 48-INCH BOTTOM FILL NOZZLE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE TANK.  INITIALLY, THE LEAKAGE RATE WAS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT FIVE GALLONS PER MINUTE, BUT WAS REDUCED TO A TRICKLE WHEN THE OIL HEAD IN THE TANK HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE MINIMUM PUMPING LEVEL.  THE ORIGINAL TANK LEVEL OF 8 FEET WAS REDUCED TO .39 FEET BY 1830 HOURS.  AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE 48-INCH VALVES TO THETANK ARE CLOSED, THE TANK IS PARTIALLY INERTED WITH NITROGEN AND THE EXTERNAL LEAKAGE FROM THE TANK HAS ESSENTAILLY STOPPED. THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF WATER AND OIL REMOVED FROM THE TANK VAULT IS ESTIMATED TO BE 270 BARRELS. THE RECOVERED OIL AND WATER WAS INJECTED BACK INTO THE SYSTEM, RESULTING IN NO KNOWN MEASUREABLE LOSS.  PLANS HAVE BEEN MADE TO COMPLETELY INERT THE TANK ATMOSPHERE WITH NITROGEN AS AN EXTRA SAFETY PRECAUTION AND TO ARRANGE FOR CLEANING ANDTOTAL ISOLATION (BLINDING) OF THE  TANK CONNECTIONS.  WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ENOUGH LIQUID NITROGEN ON SITE BY DECEMBER 29, 1990 TO FINISH THE NITROGEN PURGE, WHICH WILL TAKE ABOUT TWO FULL DAYS.  AFTER THE NITROGEN PURGE THE TANK WILL BE VENTILATED WITH AIR AND BLINDS WILL BE PLACED IN ALL OF THE TANK NOZZLE.  THIS WILL PROBABLY TAKE AN ADDITIONAL TWO TO THREE DAYS. IF THIS EFFORT GOES SMOOTHLY, IN SPITE OF THE EXTREME COLD WEATHER WORKING CONDITIONS, WE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERIOR OF THE TANK BY ABOUT DECEMBER 29 OR 30, 1990.AT THAT TIME, WE WILL START THE CLEANING OF THE TANK SO THAT IT CAN BE INSPECTED AND THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK DETERMINED.  THE NATURE OF THE NECESSARY REPAIR CAN NOT BE ASSESSED UNTIL AFTER THE CLEANING IS WELL UNDERWAY."

ADJACENT VALVES WERE CLOSED ISOLATING A 13 MILE SECTION OF LINE.  STOPPLE EQUIPMENT WAS BROUGHT ON SITE, HOWEVER, BY THE TIME PREPARATIONS COULD BE MADE, THE LINE FILL WAS VIRTUALLY GONE SO THE REMAINDER WAS ALLOWED TO BLOW DOWN.  A NEARBY RAILROAD AND HIGHWAY WERE SHUTDOWN TEMPORARILY UNTIL THE VAPOR CLOUD TOTALLY DISPERED.  THE LINE WAS REPAIRED BY INSTALLING A NEW JOINT OF PIPE.  THE CONTRACTOR, VAN BUSKIRK CONSTRUCTION, WAS WORKING UNDER A JOINTCONTRACT WITH THE SOUTH DAKOTA AND IOWA DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION TO BUILD DIRT BERMS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW INTERSTATE BRIDGE ACROSS THE BIG SIOUX RIVER.  THE CONTRACTOR CALLED THE IOWA ONE-CALL (COPY OF THE NOTICE ATTACHED), HOWEVER, THE REPORTED ""EXTENT OF WORK"" IN THE NOTICE WAS LIMITED TO EITHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE.  THE NOTICE ALSO GAVE SPECIFIC WORK LOCATION REFERENCE TO SECTION 15 IN SIOUX COUNTY, IOWA, HOWEVER, THE PIPELINE WAS STRUCK IN SECTION 10 IN UNION COUNTY, SOUTH DAKOTA.  WHEN WE RECEIVED THE ONE-CALL NOTICE WE CALLED THE COTNRACTOR TO VERIFY THE EXTENT TO THE WORK ACTIVITY.  THE CONTRACTOR MADE MENTION ONLY OF THE WORK AT THE BRIDGE SITE, AND SINCE OUR LINE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1000 FEET TO THE WEST OF THE CONSTRUCTION (SEE ATTACHED MAPS), THE NOTICE WAS CLEARED.  HOWEVER, THE CONTRACTOR FAILED TO INFORM US THAT HE WAS TAKING DIRT FROM A BORROW PIT APPROXIMATELY 1/2 MILE NORTH WHICH WAS LOCATED ON TOP OF OUR PIPELINE.  THE ENGINEERING PLANS FOR THE BORROW PIT EXCAVATION SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED THE CONTRACTOR TO CALL THE PIPELINE COMPANIES IN THE AREA BEFORE BEGINNING ANY EXCAVATION ACTIVITY.  WE WERE NOT GIVEN ACOPY OF THESE PLANS NOR WERE WE INFORMED OF THE PRE-CONSTRUCTION MEETING WERETHEY WERE DISCUSSED.  THE NEAREST PIPELINE MARKER WAS APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET AWAY FROM THE LEAK SITE, AND CLEARLY VISIBLE.  BOTH THE CONTRACTOR AND THE LANDOWNER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY KNEW OF THE PIPELINES PRESENCE AND HAD SEEN THE PIPELINE MARKERS.  THE LANDOWNER HAD ALSO BEEN SENT A COPY OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION BROCHURE IN 1989."

AT 12:43 THE HARRIS COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED TO REPORT A PIPELINE FIRE NEAR EXPLORER'S MILE POST MARKER AT SPRING CREEK AND WERE TRYING TO IDENTIFY IF THE FIRE WAS ON ONE OF THREE PIPELINES IN THE AREA.  EXPLORER'SOPERATIONS COORDINATOR CONTACTED EXPLORER EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL AND IMMEDIATELY INITIATED SHUT DOWN OF THE 28"" PIPELINE AT 12:44 AND DECREASED PRESSURE AT THE SITE BY OPERATING DOWNSTREAM PUMPS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.  REMOTE CONTROLLED BLOCK VALVES AT MILEPOSTS 87.9 AND 101.4 WERE COMMANDED TO CLOSE AT 12:49 AND 12:58 RESPECTIVELY.  THE FIRST EXPLORER EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON THE SITE AT 13:35 AND CONFIRMED IT WAS EXPLORER'S BLOCK VALVE AT MILEPOST 92.4 THAT WAS ON FIRE.  GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCIES WERE NOTIFIED WAS REQUIRED.  VACUUM TRUCKS, SPILL RESPONSE PERSONNEL AND PIPELINE REPAIR CONTRACTORS AND EQUIPMENT WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE.  THE SITE WAS VERY REMOTE WITH NO RESIDENCES OR PUBLIC DWELLINGS ENDANGERED.  WITH CONCURRENCE OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT OFFICER ON SITE, THE GASOLINE-FED FIRE WAS ALLOWED TO CONTIINUE BURNING AFTER FLOW FROM THE ISOLATED LINE SECTION STOPPED.  THE FIRE WAS CONFINED TO THE IMMEDIATE AREA AROUND THE BLOCK VALVE AND ITS SECURITY FENCE.  THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED WITH A FEW SHOVELS OF SAND AT 18:30.  IN ADDITION TO ISOLATING THE LINE SEGMENT, TRENCHES WERE DUG AND A SPILL CONTAINMENT BOOM WAS PLACED IN SPRING CREEK AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE TO PREVENT ANY MIGRATING PRODUCT FROM ENTERING THE STREAM.  ALL PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED IN THE EXCAVATION AREA AND PICKED UP BY VACUUM TRUCK.  NONE WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER SPRINGREEK.  AN ESTIMATED 44 BARRELS OF NO-LEAD GASOLINE WERE EITHER CONSUMED IN THE FIRE OR INVOLVED WITH SOIL CONTAMINATION.  DRAIN DOWN OF THE PIPELINE WAS STARTED AT 16:55 MARCH 1ST WITH FINAL EVACUATION COMPLETELY BY VACUUM TRUCKS ON MARCH 2ND.  INSPECTION OF THE BLOCK VALVE WITH THE MANUFACTURER'S REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED THAT A STEM SEAL FAILURE WAS THE PROBABLE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  IGNITION SOURCE OF THE FIRE HAD NOT BEEN DETERMINED.  THE VALVE WAS REPAIRED BY INSTALLING NEW INTERNAL PARTS AND REPLACING THE HAND WHEEL OPERATOR.  ON MARCH 3RD, PRIOR TO RESTARTING THE PIPELINE, THE LINE WAS SLOWLY REPRESSURED TO CHECK THE VALVE REPAIR.  A SMALL LEAK ORIGINATING FROM A FAILURE IN THE VALVE BODY WAS DISCOVERED.  IT WAS DECIDED TO REPAIR THE LINE BY TEMPORARILY REMOVING THE VALVE AND REPLACING IT WITH A PIECE OF PIPE TO RESUME OPERATION UNTIL A REPLACEMENT 28"" VALVE WAS LOCATED.  THIS PLAN WAS ALSO REVIEWED WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY, SOUTHWEST REGION, HOUSTON, TEXAS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION.  NEARBY BLOCKVALVES AT MILEPOSTS 92.19 AND 96.0 ARE BEING UTILIZED UNTIL THE NEW VALVE ISINSTALLED.  DUE TO ABNORMAL RAINS AND TIME REQUIRED TO VAPOR FREE THE AREA FOR SAFE WELDING, REPAIRS WERE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 7TH.  THE PIPELINE RESUMED FULL OPERATION AT 1:00 MARCH 8TH.  A REPLACEMNT VALVE ID SCHEDULED FOR INSTALLATION ON ABOUT APRIL 6, 1992.  SOIL REMEDIATION PLANS ARE BEING COORDINATED WITH TEXAS WATER COMMISSION."

HE HAD ALREADY CALLED 911AND, LEFT IMMEDIATELY TO GO TO THE FIRE.  HE DISCOVERED THAT A 200 HO VERTICAL CAN PUMP ADJACENT TO TANK 1241 WAS ON FIRE.  THE FIRE WAS APPROXIMATELY 8 TO 10 FEET SOUTH OF THE TANK.  THE WIND WAS ACARRING THE HEAT AND FLAME AWAY FROM THE TANK INTO ADJACENT MANIFOLD AREA.  WPL EMPLOYEES FROM THE KANSAS CITY COMPLEX AND KANSAS CITY MAINTENANCE CREW, FOUGHT THE FIRE USING DRY CHEMICAL EXTINGUISHERS.  THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN KNOCKING THE FIRE DOWN BUT WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETELY EXTINGUISH IT WITH THE EQUIPMENT AVIALABLE.  A GASOLINE MIST CONTINUED TO SPRAY FROM THE PUMP AND WAS REIGNITED BY THE HOT PIPING IN THEMANIFOLD AREA.  THE KANSAS CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON SITE VERY QUICKLYAND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE USING FOAM AND WATER.  IN ALL, THE FIRE LASTED APPROXIMATELY 17 MINUTES.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES.  DUE TO THE QUICK RESPONSE OFOUR EMPLOYEES AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE DAMAGE WAS KEPT TO A MININUM.  THERE WAS NO SPILL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT AS ALL GASOLINE SPRAYING FROM THE PUMP WAS CONSUMED IN THE FIRE.  CAUSE:  THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY A THRUST BEARING FAILURE ON THE BOOSTER PUMP MOTOR.  WHEN THE BEARING FAILED, THE MOTORDROPPED SLIGHTLY, ALLOWING GASOLINE TO SPRAY OUT FROM THE PUMP SEAL. THE BEARING FAILURE ALSO CREATED METAL TO METAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE SEAL COLLAR AND THE GLAND PLATE.  THIS WAS THE HEAT SOURCE WHICH CAUSED IGNITION.   DAMAGE:  THE 200 HP PUMP ANDMOTOR SUSTAINED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE.  IN ADDITION, AN ADJACENT 200 HP VERTICAL CAN PUMP WAS SLIGHTLY DAMAGED.  THE FIRE DESTROYED SIX MOTOR OPERATORS MOUNTED ON GENERAL TWIN SEAL VALVES IN THE MANIFOLD AREA  MUCHOF THE CONDUIT AND WIRING FOR THESE OPERATORS AND FOR THE BOOSTER PUMPS WAS ALSO DESTROYED.  THE TOTAL DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED TO BE $50,000.

THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED WITH POWER AND FOAM,AND THERE WERE NO INJURIED NOR IMMEDIATE DANGER TO EMPLOYEES OF THE GENERALPUBLIC. ON MARCH 11, 1992, AT 1711 HRS. CST, MID-VALLEY'S 22"" PIPELINE. LOCATED NEAR LEITCHFIEDL, GRAYSON COUNTY, KY, RUPTURED SPILLING APPROXIMATELY3,780 BBLS. OF CRUDE OIL INTO HARGUS CREEK AND BEAR CREEK.  THE DROP IN PRESSURE WAS NOTED BY  OUR DISPATCHERS AT LONGVIEW, TX, AND IMMEDIATE ACTION WASTAKEN TO SHUTDOWN AND ISOLATE THE LINE SECTION INVOLVED. SUCH ACTION WAS TAKEN PRIOR TO RECEIVING NOTIFICATION FROM ON OF OUR GRANTORS AND THE SHERIFF'SDEPT., GRAYSON COUNTY.  THE LONGITUDINALLY ORIENTED SPLIT IN THE X52, .300"",SEAMLESS PIPE, WAS 23"" LONG ( AT THE 6:00 O'CLOCK POSITION), AND 3"" WIDE ATTHE CENTER.  THE PIPE WALL WAS WEAKENED BY THE LOSS OF METAL FROM EXTERNAL LOCALIZED CORROSION THAT EXTENDED FOR 65"".  THE REMAINING WALL THICKNESS ALONGTHE SPLIT RANGED FROM 50 TO 200 MILS.  A CLOSE INTERVAL SURVEY, DONE IN 1990,1990, IDEICATED THAT THE PIPELINE WAS PROPERLY PROTECTED, WITH READINGS WELLABOVE 900MV, NEGATIVE, IN THE AREA OF THE FAILURE.  REPAIRE TO THE 22"" PIPELINE WERE COMPLETED AND THE LINE RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 1000HRS., MARCH 14,BY REMOVING A 57' SECTION OF PIPE, AND INSERTING 57' OF NEW PRETESTED .375""WALL X52 PIPE.  THIS AMOUNT OF PIPE WAS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE PROPER LINEUPPRIOR TO WELDING.  HOT TAPS WERE MADE APPROXIMATELY 1000' EITHER SIDE OF THEREPAIR SECTION IN ORDER TO REMOVE ANY REMAINING OIL IN THE PIPELINE, AND TOENSURE SAFETY DURING THE WELDING PROCESS.  ALL OF THE WELDS USED IN THISREPAIR WERE 100% X-RAYED.  THE LINE PRESSURE IN THIS AREA OF FAILURE ISBEING HELD TO A MAXIMUM OF 300 PSI UNTIL INSPECTION BY A MAGNAFLUX ""SMART PIG"" IS COMPLETE IN EARLY APRIL, 1992."

ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 27, 1994, UNION PACIFIC RESOURCES (UPRC) USED A CONTRACTOR TO EXCAVATE A 6"" GAS GATHERING LINE OPERATED BY UPRC IN ORDER TO INSTALL A RISER AND VALVE. THE CONTRACTOR WAS TOLD ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE PANOLA 8"" LIQUID PIPELINE WHICH WAS ADJACENT TO THE PIPELINE BEING EXCAVATED. EVEN THOUGHTHE 8"" LIQUID LINE MAY HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY MARKED FOR EARLIER EXCAVATION IN THE SAME AREA, IT WAS NOT MARKED THAT DAY. IT WAS RAINING THAT DAY. THE HOEEXCAVATED NEAR AND ABOVE THE SANJAC LINE. HOWEVER, THE SANJAC LINE WAS NOT EXPOSED DURING THIS OPERATION. AN EXAMINATION OF THE SANJAC PIPELINE AFTER THERUPTURE FOUND THE LINE HAD SEVERE MECHANICAL DAMAGE THAT HAD GOUGED AND DENTED THE PIPE. ALTHOUGH, IT CAN NOT BE DETERMINED EXACTLY WHEN THE DAMAGE OCCURRED, IT IS FELT THAT THIS DAMAGE WAS THE RESULT OF THE HOE HITTING THE PIPELINE DURING THE EXCAVATION ON JANUARY 27, 1994. MECHANICAL DAMAGE WAS FOUND IN TWO OTHER AREAS NEAR THE RUPTURE POINT. THE CONTRACTOR HAS TOLD UPRC THAT THEHOE OPERATOR DID NOT EXPOSED, UPRC AND PANOLA DID NOT KNOW THAT ANY DAMAGE HAD OCCURRED. ON THURSDAY THE SANJAC PIPELINE WAS FLOWING LESS VOLUMES THAN NORMAL. THE FLOW WAS AVERAGING 170 BARRELS PER HOUR (BPH). STARTING ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1994, THE FLOW THROUGH THE PIPELINE BEGAN TO BE INCREASED TO START BRINGING IT BACK UP TO NORMAL FLOW. ABOUT 1:00 AM SATURDAY MORNING, JANUARY29, 1994 THE FLOW WAS RAISED TO 380 BPH. AT 4:25 AM ON THAT MORNING THE PIPELINE RUPTURED. IT IGNITED WITHIN MINUTES OF THE RUPTURE. THE LOCATION OF THE RUPTURE IS REMOTE AND THE SOURCE OF IGNITION SPARKS FROM ROCKS BEING THROWN AROUND. THE PRESSURE LOSS WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTICED BY THE SCADA SYSTEM. WITHIN 10 MINUTES THAT PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN. THE MANUAL VALVE AT THE EAST TEXAS PLANT, WHICH IS THE CLOSEST VALVE UPSTREAM OF THE RUPTURE WAS CLOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 4:54 AM. THE MANUAL VALVE ON THE PIPELINE IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM OF THERUPTURE WAS CLOSED APPROXIMATELY 5:30 AM. THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE CAUSED SEVERAL GATHERING PIPELINES WHICH HAD ABOVEGROUND FACILITIES ADJACENT TO THE SANJAC LINE TO FAIL. THE POINTS OF FAILURE WERE THE INSULATING FLANGES WHERE THE INSULATING GASKETS MELTED. THE GAS AND LIQUID FROM THESE PIPELINES WERE ISOLATED AND THE CONTENTS OF THE PIPELINES WERE ALLOWED TO BURN OUT. THE FIRES WERE UNDER CONTROL BY 8:30 AM. DUE TO THE REMOTE LOCATION AND THE EARLY MORNING HOUR OF THE FAILURE, THERE WERE NO INJURIES."

OILMOVEMENTS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN BOTH WOOD RIVER LINES AND BEGAN THEIR EMERGECY NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES. COMPANY PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO ISOLATE THE DAMAGED LINE SEGMENT. VALVES WERE CLOSED AT RICHLAND STATION, MILE POST 327, AND AT CROCKER, MILE POST 340. THE PUNCTURE WAS LOCATED A MILE POST 337.8. AFTER ISOLATING THE DAMAGED SEGMENT OF LINE, CPL WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL EMERGECY RESPONDERS TO COORDINATE EMERGECY RESPONSE EFFORTS. THE EVACUATION OF 4 HOUSEHOLDS WERE NECESSARY TO MINIMIZE DANGER TO THE OCCUPANTS. DURING THEDAYLIGHT HOURS FOLLOWING THE RELEASE, THE PROPANE CLOUD WAS DISSIPATING RAPIDLY AND, THEREFORE, WAS BEING ALLOWED TO VENT. HOWEVER, AS EVENING APPROACHEDWEATHER CONDITIONS BEGAN TO CHANGE. IT WAS FEARED THAT THE PROPANE WOULD BEGIN POOLING AND POSSIBLY REACH AN ACCIDENTAL IGNITION SOURCE. FOR THIS REASON,IT WAS DECIDED TO INTENTIONALLY IGNITE THE VAPOR CLOUD ADJACENT TO THE DAMAGED PIPELINE. ALL NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL WERE MOVED TO SHELTERING POSITIONS, WHILE CPL PERSONNEL, ALONG WITH THE PULASKI COUNTY SHERIFF MOVED INTO POSITION TO IGNITE THE VAPOR CLOUD. WHEN EVERYONE WAS SATISFIED THAT ALL POSSIBLE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN, FLARES WERE FIRED INTO THE CLOUD BY A CPL EMPLOYEE, IGNITING THE VAPOR CLOUD. STOPPLE EQUIPMENT WAS THEN MOVED IN AND INSTALLED TO REDUCE PRODUCT LOSS AND SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED TO FLARETHE EXISTING LINE FILL. WHEN LOCAL PERSONNEL WERE SATISFIED THAT THE LINE FILL HAD BEEN FLARED SUFFICIENTLY TO EFFECT REPLACEMENT OF THE DAMAGED SECTION SAFELY, WORK WAS BEGUN. THE DAMAGED SECTION OF LINE WAS REMOVED AND THE REPAIRED LINE WAS LOWERED TO A DEPTH OF 36 INCHES TO PREVENT FUTURE DAMAGED OF THIS TYPE. THE EXCAVATION REQUIRED THE USE OF ROCK BREAKING EQUIPMENT TO REACH THE 36 INCH DEPTH. THE SECOND LINE WAS ALSO LOWERED AS A PRECAUTION. UPON COMPLETION OF THESE REPAIRS, THE STOPPLE EQUIPMENT WAS ALSO REMOVED AND AFFECTED JOINT CUT OUT AND REPLACED. ROAD GRADER WAS BEING OPERATED BY STANLEY CHRISTMAN AN EMPLOYEE OF PULASKI COUNTY.

THIS PROCESS INVOLVED ISOLATING A 3' SECTION OF PIPE WITH VALVES ON EACH SIDE AND OPEINIG A DRAIN VALVE ON THE STRAINER TO RELIEVE PRESSURE. THE TWO ISOLATING VALVES WERE LOCKED OUT AND TAGGED, THE DRAIN VALVE WAS TAGGED, HOWEVER NOT LOCKED DUE THE NEED TO OPERATE THE VALVE FOR PRESSURE RELIEF. UPON COMPLETIONOF THE TASK, THE DRAIN VALVE WAS SUPPOSEDLY CLOSED AND THE ISOLATION VALVES WERE ERE UNLOCKED/UNTAGGED AND THE SYSTEM WAS PLACED BACK TO NORMAL. AT 0500,MARCH 29, DALLAS PLOCC OPENED THE DELIVERY VALVE AND BEGAN DELIVERY INTO SYRACUSE TANKAGE. AT 0645, AN EMPLOYEE DRIVING OVER THE BEAR STREET BRIDGE, NOTICED A GASOLINE ODOR. HE PROCEEDED ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND DROVE TO THE MANIFOLDAREA, AT WHICH TIME HE NOTICED PRODUCT ON THE GROUND INSIDE THE DIKE AREA OFTHE MANIFOLD. HE APPROACHED THE AREA TO INVESTIGATE CAUSE OF THE LEAK AND FOUND THAT THE DRAIN VALVE ON THE STRAINER WAS NOT COMPLETELY CLOSED. HE CLOSEDTHE VALVE AND OBSERVED THAT THE LEAK HAD STOPPED. HE THEN LEFT THE AREA TO GET HELP AND INITIATE SYSTEM SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS. THE SYSTEM WAS SHUTDOWN AT 0653 BY DALLAS CONTROL CENTER. EMPLOYEES OBSERVED THAT THE LEAK WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE DIKE AREA, BLOCKED THE ENTRANCES OFF, CONTACTED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND CLEAN UP CONTRACTOR. THE CLEANUP CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 0745 TO BEGIN RECOVERY OPERATIONS. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME AND BLOCKED THE BEAR STREET BRIDGE FROM TRAFFICC AS A PRECAUTION. AFTER NOTIFICATION, THE NYDEC ARRIVED ON SCENE TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION AND AGREED WITH OUR RECOVERY AND CLEANUP PLANS. AT APPROXIMATELY 1145, THE M AINFOLD AREA WAS INSPECTED BY MOBIL EMPLOYEES TO ENSURE SAFE OPERATION.

A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INCIDENT LOCATION IS: NORTH OF HIGHWAY 23, APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES WEST OF NEW TOWN, NORTH DAKOTA, AND 1/4 MILE EAST OF FOUR BEARS BRIDGE, SECTION 14, T152N, R93W, MONTRAIL COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA. A TOTAL OF 1136 BARRELS (47,712 GALLONS) OF UNLEADED GASOLINE WAS LEAKED; APPROXIMATELY 330 BARRELS (13,860 GALLONS) OF WHICH WAS RECOVERED AND TRANSPORTED TO THE CENEX PIPELINE TERMINAL IN MINOT, NORTH DAKOTA. THE LOSS OF PIPELINE PRESSURE RESULTING FROM THE RUPTURE WAS IMMEDIATELY DETECTED AT THE PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER IN LAUREL, MONTANA, AND THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN BY 4:16 P.M. THE STAT CONTRACTOR USED EARTH-MOVING EQUIPMENTON SITE TO CONSTRUCT BERMS WHICH CONTAINED THE GASOLINE, AND MINIMIZED THE VOLUME REACHING NEARBY LAKE SAKAKAWEA. BLOCK VALVES LOCATED ON EACH SIDE OF THERUPTURE WERE CLOSED, ISOLATING THE SECTION OF PIPELINE. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES WERE NOTIFIED THROUGH THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. CENEXRESPONSE  CREWS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE, WORKING THROUGH THE NIGHT TO PUMP THE CONTAINED GASOLINE INTO TANK TRUCKS,AND TO INSURE THAT NONE OF IT REACHED THE WATER. SORBENT MATERAILS AND CONTAINMENT BOOMS WEREDEPLOYED NEAR THE SHORE OF LAKE SAKAKAWEA AS A PECAUTIONARY MEASURE IN THEEVENT THAT SEEPA GE OF GASOLINE TO THE LAKE SHOULD OCCUR. VISUAL ON-GROUNDINSPECTIONS OF THE SHORELINE ADJACENT TO THE RUPTURE CONDUCTED THROUGHOUT THEFIRST NIGHT DID NO T DETECT THE PRESENCE OF MEASURABLE OIL ON THE WATERSURFACE. A 3"" - TO 4"" - WIDE SHEEN WAS OBSERVED, WHICH EXTENDED FORAPPROXIMATELY 20 FEET OF THE SHOR ELINE ADJACENT TO THE RUPTURE. ON THEMORNING OF OCTOBER 5, THE SHORELINES NE AR THE SITE WERE INSPECTED BY AIRCRAFTAND BY BOAT TO VERIFY THAT GASOLINE WAS NOT REACHING THE WATER. FOLLOWINGRECOVERY OF THE CONTAINED GASOLINE, TRENC HES WERE EXCAVATED TO RECOVERADDITIONAL GASOLINE AND IMPACTED GROUNDWATER. THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPELINEWAS REPLACED BY OCTOBER 6. APPROXIMATELY 5,570 CUBIC YARDS OFGASOLINE-IMPACTED SOIL WAS EXCAVATED FROM THE SITE, AND REMOV ED TO ASTATE-APPROVED LANDFARM FACILITY FOR TREATMENT DURING THE DAYS FOLLOW ING THEINCIDENT. SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM SOIL REMAINING AT THE EXCAVATIO NSURFACES TO VERIFY THE ACHIEVED CLEANUP LEVELS. CLEAN SOILS FROM THE HIGHWA YCONSTRUCTION PROJECT WERE USED TO BACKFILL THE EXCAVATIONS. THE CLEANUP WASCOMPLETED ON WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1995. AN ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGIST FROM TH ENORTH DAKOTA DIVISION OF WATER QUALITY WAS ON SITE DURING MOST OF THE CLEAN UPEFFORT. THE SITE CLEANUP WAS ALSO MONITORED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STAT EDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, MONTRAIL COUNTY, AND FORT BERTHOLD INDIAN RESERVATION."

A COMPANY EMPLOYEE DISPATCHED TO THE AREA ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 1355 EST AND CONFIRMED THE PRODUCT WAS LEAKING AT THE DOWNSTREAM END OF A CASED, OVERHEAD CROSSING OF COLONIAL'S 8-INCH LINE THAT IS ADJACENT TO A SMALL SERVICE ROAD. THE ATLANTA CONTROLCENTER WAS NOTIFIED, AND THE LINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN. AT 1508 EST THENATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS NOTIFIED, REPORT NO. 324453, AND AT 1520 EST THE TENNESSEE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY WAS INFORMED OF THE LEAK. OTHER AGENCIES NOTIFIED INCLUDE THE CHATTANOOGA STORM WATER DIVISION AND LOCAL FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS. AFTER EXCAVATION OF THE PIPELINE AT THE END OF THE OVERHEAD SPAN, PRODUCT WAS FOUND TO BE ESCAPING FROM 3 SMALL HOLES PENETRATING THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF BOTH THE CASING PIPE AND THE CARRIER PIPE. THE LINE WAS REPAIRED INITIALLY BY INSTALLING A WELDED, SPLIT-SOLE REPAIR SLEEVE OVER THE HOLES AND RESTARTED AT A REDUCED PRESSURE ON FEBRUARY 7, 1996. THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO MONITOR THE LEAK SITE AND WHEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT WAS DETECTEDESCAPING FROM THE END OF THE CASING ON FEBRUARY 9, 1996, THE LINE WAS AGAIN SHUT DOWN TO SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL LEAKS. THE ENTIRE 120 FOOT SPAN OF CASING AND CARRIER PIPE WAS REMOVED AND INSPECTED. NO ADDITIONAL LEAKS WERE FOUND AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PRODUCT PROBABLY WAS FROM THE ORIGINAL RELEASE AND HAD BEEN TRAPPED BY ICE DAMS INSIDE THE CASING. REPAIRS TO THE LINE WERE MADE BY INSTALLING APPROXIMATELY 120 FEET OF 8.625-INCH O.D. X.322-INCH W.T. CARRIER PIPE ENCASED IN 12-INCH O.D. CASING PIPE. COLONIAL AGAIN RESTARTED THELINE ON FEBRUARY 10, 1996, AT A REDUCED PRESSURE. A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THE CAUSE OF INCIDENT WAS SOME SORT OF ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE CURRENT. AND INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE ELECTRICAL CHARGE CONTINUES AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED AT A LATER DATE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1750 BARRELS OF KEROSINE AND FUEL OIL ESCAPED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. APPROXIMATELY 44 BARRELS OF THE PRODUCT HAVE BEEN RECOVERED AND RETURNED TO THE SYSTEM. THE REMAINING PRODUCT APPARENTLY HAS SEEPED INTO THE FRACTURED ROCK, AND CAVERNS  THAT ARE PREVALENT IN THE MOUNTAIN.

THE VAULT WAS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FEED DEEP. THE OIL WAS APPROXIMATELY 18"" DEEP INTHE 36"" DIAMETER VAULT. THE PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED FROM APPROXIMATELY650 PSI TO APPROXIMATELY 325 PSI BY REDUCING THROUGHOUT AND ADJUSTING PUMP STATION SUCTION/DISCHARGE PRESSURES. THE SECOND BYPASS VALVE ON CHECK VALVE 92WAS CLOSED IN CASE THE LEAK WAS BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES VALVES. EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT WAS BROUGHT IN AND REVEALED THAT A 1/2"" SCREWED PLUG LOCATED ON THE 6"" BYPASS PIPING WAS LOOSE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OIL LEAKAGE. A NEW PIPE PLUG WAS SCREWED INTO THE THREAD-O-LET AND THE BYPASS PIPING WAS PRESSURIZED. PIPELINE PRESSURE RESTRICTIONS WERE REMOVED AT THIS POINT AND THE BYPASS PIPINGWAS CLEANED FOR INSPECTION. EXAMINATION REVEALED FIVE RADIAL CRACKS IN THE THREAD-O-LET THAT THE PIPE PLUG WAS SCREWED INTO. THE BYPASS VALVE WAS CLOSED AND THE ENTIRE FLANGED BYPASS SPOOL WAS REPLACED. EXCAVATION CONTINUES TO REMOVE THE CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM THE PIPE DITCH. THE DITCH WAS ORIGINALLY CUT INTO SOLID BEDROCK IN THE AREA OF THE LEAK TO A DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 25 FEET. EXCAVATION IS VERY SLOW DUE TO THE DEPTH OF THE HOLE, CRUDE OIL VAPOR AND THE NEED TO HAD EXCAVATE AROUND THE OPERATING PIPELINE. DURING EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES ON APRIL 27, 1996, A BACKHOE SCRAPED AGAINST THE BEDROCK AND  AUSED A SPARK TO IGNITE THE CR5UDE VAPOR IN THE DITCH. THE OPERATOR IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED THE BURNING SOIL BY SMOTHERING THE FIRE WITH A BUCKET FULL OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND NO DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE OR EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT. AS OF THIS DATE, APPROXIMATELY 250 FEET OF MAIN LINE PIPE HAS BEEN EXCAVATED AND BACKFILLED. A TOTAL OF 8,442 GALLONS OF OIL AND WATER HAS BEEN RECOVERED (2,200 GALLONS CRUDE OIL). APPROXIMATELY 3,200 CUBIC YARDSO F CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS BEEN EXCAVATED. APPROXIMATELY 1,500 CUBIC YARDS HAS BEENCHARACTERIZED AS HEAVILY CONTAMINATED WITH REMAINDER BEING LIGHTLY CONTAMINATED. THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF CONTAMINATED SOILS WAS FOUND ON MAY 14TH. HOWEVER, EXCAVATION IS NOT COMPLETE SINCE THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. A TEST HOLE TO EXPOSE THE PIPE 200 FEET NORTH (DOWNHILL) FROM THE VALVE SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF CRUDE OIL OR BENZENE VAPORS. THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT EXCAVATION IS MORE THAN 50% COMPLETE. THE PIPE DITCH IS IN SOLID BEDROCK AND IS QUITE IMPENETRABLE. NO EVIDENCE HAS BEEN FOUNDTHAT INDICATES THE CRUDE OIL IS MIGRATING OUT OF THE PIPE TRENCH. A SUPPLEMENTAL ACCIDENT REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN FINAL SPILL ESTIMATES ARE COMPLETE. THIS ACCIDENT WAS REPORTED BY TELEPHONE ON APRIL 20, 1996. IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE SPILL VOLUME AND REPAIRS WOULD EXCEED THE REPORTING LIMIT. THE SMALL FIRE ON APRIL 27TH WAS REPORTED TO THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REPRESENTATIVE ONLY. THE CAUSE OF THE SPILL APPEARS TO BE CAUSED BY THE INADEQUATEDESIGN AND INSTALLATION OF A VALVE ACTUATOR VAULT IN 1982 THAT WAS BEARING ON THE 1/2"" THREADED PIPE PLUG. THE VAULT CAUSED THE THREAD-O-LET TO CRACK ANDLEAK. THERE ARE 40 BELOW GRADE MAINLINE CHECK VALVES IN THE SYSTEM. ALL HAVEBEEN VISUALLY INSPECTED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT EXCAVATION AND NO ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED."

THESE PROCEDURES WERE IMMEDIATELY REVIEWED WITH ALL OF THE OPERATORS AT THE WOOD RIVER FACILITY. THE OPERATOR ONDUTY AT THE TIME OF THE OVERFILL WAS REPRIMANDED. THE SECOND HUMAN FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERFILL OF THE TANK WAS THE EXCEEDING OF THE WRITTEN DELIVERY ORDERS BY THE THIRD PARTY PIPELINE OPERATOR. THE THIRD FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE TANK OVERFILL IS A MECHANICAL ONE. THE HIGH LEVEL ALARM SYSTEM THAT SHOULD HAVE TRIGGERED, BOTH AUDIBLE AND VISUAL ALARMS, AT BOTH THE FACILITY AND AT CPL'S OIL MOVEMENTS GROUP CONTROL ROOM IN HOUSTON, DID NOT FUNCTION. UPON A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE EQUIPMENT, BOTH ELECTRICAL ANFD MECHANICAL, NO PROBLEMS COULD BE FOUND. THE EQUIPMENT WAS TESTED MULTIPLE TIMES BY PHYSICALLY RAISING THE PRODUCT LEVEL IN THE EXTERIOR STAND PIPE OF THE TANK WITH A PRESSURE PUMP. THE EQUIPMENT FUNCTIONED CORRECTLY AND THE ALARMS WERE RECEIVED AT BOTH LOCATIONS IN ALL OF THE TEST. ADDITIONALLY, QUARTERLY MAINTENANCE RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS ALSO FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY DURING THE PREVIOUS TEST CONDUCTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT BECAUSE THE TANK IS IN TRANSMIX SERVICE, DEBRIS FROM THE OFF-SPEC PRODUCT MUST HAVE BECOME LODGED IN THE STAND PIPE ORIFICE AND PIPING, AT THE POINT WHERE THE STAND PIPE IS CONNECTED TO THE TANK, SUCH THE TANK HEAD ALONE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DISLODGE THE DEBRIS AND TRIGGER THE ALARM.

MPL EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTORS RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND FOUND THAT THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A MILESTONE BULLDOZER EXCAVATING FOR THE EXPANSION OF A PAVED AREA. THE PRODUCT IN THE PIPELINE WAS LOW SULFUR DIESEL FUEL. ONE OF THE MILESTONE EQUIPMENT OPERATORS AND A MILESTONE LABORER WERE SPRAYED WITH DIESEL AND THE EQUIPMENT OPERATOR WAS TREATED AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL. UPON HITTING THE PIPELINE, MILESTONE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN CONSTRUCTING AN EARTHEN DAM TO CONTAIN THE ESCAPING PRODUCT. WHEN MPL RESPONDERS AND CONTRACTORS ARRIVED, THEY REMOVED THE MILESTONE PERSONNEL TO A SAFE AREA AND CONTAINED THE PRODUCT. THE AIRPORT WAS TEMPORARILY SHUT DOWN. IT WAS REOPENED ON JUNE 2, 1996. A 10 FOOT SECTION OF PIPE, CONTAINING THE DAMAGED AREA, WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH NEW,HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED PIPE.

AT 00:17 HRS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE IN APROX 30 MINS. DUE TO THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND BLOWING THE FLAMES AWAY FROM THE TANK AND QUICK RESPONSE FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE FIRE WAS ISOLATED DAMAGING ONLY THE BOOSTER PUMPAND MOTOR. AN INVESTIGATION AT THE SITE INDICATED ONLY ONE BARREL OF FUEL OIL WAS LOST, WHICH WAS CONSUMED IN THE FIRE.

THE INDIVIDUAL REPORTINGTHE POSSIBLE RELEASE WAS DRIVING A VEHICLE IN THE VICINITY OF VALVE STATION 31 ON TEX'S GULF COAST PIPELINE (GCPL) AT TIME OF THE OBSERVATION. VALVE STATION 31 IS LOCATED IN BRAZORIA COUNTY. AT THE TIME OF THE REPORT, THE 6"" GCPL WAS NOT IN OPERATION AND WAS ISOLATED BY CLOSED VALVES FROM SUPPLIERS. AFTER RECEIVING THE REPORT OF A POSSIBLE RELEASE, TEX PERSONNEL AT LONGVIEW IMMEDIATELY CLOSED A REMOTE OPERATED VALVE (VS-22) NORTH OF THE LEAK SITE AND SHORTLY AFTER ALSO CLOSED REMOTE OPERATED VS-27. IN ADDITION, TEX IMMEDIATELY: (1) CONTACTED TEX SUPERVISION; (2) DISPATCHED PERSONNEL TO THE RELEASE SITE, INCLUDING TWO BENSON PIPELINE MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL FROM THE HOUSTON AREA AND ONETEX PIPELINE INSPECTOR FROM LONGVIEW, AND (3) CONTACTED THE WEST COLUMBIA FIRE DEPARTMENT BY TELEPHONE. TEX PERSONNEL CONTINUED TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND BY APPROX 8:15 P.M. HAD CONCLUDED THAT THE RELEASE WAS SIGNIFICANT AND INVOLVED THE TEX 6"" GCPL. ADDITIONAL TEX PERSONNEL WERE THEN DISPATCHED TO THE RELEASE SITE. BY APPROX 8:30 PM, BENSON PIPELINE MAINTENANCE REPS COMPLETED ON-SITE INSPECTIONS OF THE PIPELINE VALVES IMMEDIATELY NORTH (VS-32) OF THE RELEASE AT VALVE STATION 31. THE BENSON REPS FOUND THAT BOTH VALVES, VS-30, AND VS-32, HAD CLOSED PRIOR TO ARRIVAL THROUGH AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION OF THE LOW PRESSURE SHUTDOWNS. TO REDUCE PIPELINE PRESSURE AT THE RELEASE SITE, FLARING WAS PROMPTLY ACTIVATED AT VALVE STATION 30. AS CONDITIONS IMPROVED ATTHE SITE, VISUAL INSPECTION CONFIRMED THAT VALVE STATION 31 HAD REMAINED IN THE OPEN POSITION, AND THAT THE RELEASE WAS ORIGINATING FROM A SMALL HOLE LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF ABOVE GROUND PIPING A FEW FEET SOUTH OF VALVE 31. TOEXPEDITE TERMINATING THE RELEASE, TEX INSTALLED ADDITIONAL HIGH CAPACITY FLARING EQUIPMENT AT VS-30. TEX ALSO MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR INSTALLATION OF A STOPPLE IN THE PIPELINE APPROX TWO MILES SOUTH OF THE RELEASE SITE IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF PIPELINE REQUIRED TO BE FLARED. BY 11:00PM, 12/06, THE CONTROLLED FLARING PROCESS HAD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED THE RATE OF RELEASE AT VS-31. TEX REPS THEN MANUALLY CLOSED VS-31 AND APPLIED A CLAMP OVER THE BULLET HOLE IN THE PIPING. APPLICATION OF THE CLAMP TERMINATED THE RELEASE AT ABOUT 11:15PM ON 12/06. THE BRAZORIA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE INSPECTED THE 1/2"" DIAMETER HOLE IN THE ABOVE GROUND PIPING CONFIRMED THAT THE LINE HAD BEEN SHOT BYAN UNKNOWN PERSON. SPENT SHELL CASINGS, INCLUDING ONE 30-06 CASING, WERE FOUND ON THE COUNTY ROAD AND ESTIMATED 150 FEET FROM AND WITHIN CLEAR SIGHT OF THE HOLE.

WPL PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE FIELD TO INVESTIATE THE TANK LINES AND THE AREA AROUND TANK 1310. AT THIS TIME IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE PUMP RECIEVE VALVE ON THE PUMP MANIFOLD WAS CLOSED. THIS INDICATED THAT 18"" LINE TOTANK 1310 WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE STATIC CHECK OF THE TANK ONLY. WHILE INSPECTING THE AREA AROUND TANK 1310, DEAD VEGETATION WAS FOUND NORTH OF THETANK.  IT APPEARED THAT THIS WAS A RESULT OF WEED SPRAYING THAT WAS APPLIED IN 1996.  THE AREA WAS PROBED BUT NO DETECTION OF PRODUCT COULD BE FOUND.  ON TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 1997, THE RESULTS OF THE STATIC TANK CHECK INDICATED THATTHE TANK WAS NOT LEAKING. AT THIS TIME, IT APPEARED THAT EITHER THE MANIFOLD VALVE WAS LEAKING, ALLOWING PRODUCT TO MOVE FROM TANK 1310 TO TANK 836, WHICH SHARES THE SAME HEADER, OR THAT THE UNDERGROUND LINE WAS LEAKING.  THEMAINTENANCE CREW WAS SENT TO PERFORM A PRESSURE TEST ON THE 18"" LINE.

THE QUARTER INCH HOLE IN THE 6 OCLOCK POSITION OF THEPIPE WAS IDENTIFIED AS INTERNAL CORROSION.  AN ULTRASONIC EXAMINATION IN THE AREA AROUND THE LEAK INDICATED THAT THIS WAS AN ISOLATED CONDITION. IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON, SAND WAS BROUGHT IN TO LINE THE DITCH TO ISOLATE THE HYDROCARBON VAPORS IN ORDER THAT A PATCH COULD BE SAFELY WELDED ON THE LINE.THIS WAS COMPLETED AT 1430 HOURS.  REMEDIATION OF THE SITE CONTINUED BY DIGGING TRENCHES AND USING VACUUM TRUCKS AND SKIMMERS TO PICK UP THE FREE PRODUCT.  IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE PLUME, DRILLING RIGS WERE BROUGHT IN TO DRILL 28 MONITORING WELLS.  FROM THE INFORMATION OF FREE PRODUCT STANDING IN EACH WELL, AS WELL AS FROM REVIEWING PAST RECORDS REGARDING TANK 1310 OPERATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT 30,000 BARRELS HAD LEAKED OUT OF THE LINE OVER A 2.5 YEAR PERIOD.  THE REMEDIATION OF THIS SITE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS AND THE ESTIMATED TOTAL PROPERTY DAMAGE RECORDED EARLIER IN THIS REPORT REFLECTS ANTICIPATED COSTS FOR THE ENTIRE REMEDIATION PERIOD.

THE CASING WAS EXCAVATED AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT (LESS THAN ONE GALLON) WAS OBSERVED COMING FROM THE CASING.

APPROXIMATELY 294 FEET OF 0.500"" WALL THICKNESS, X-52 PIPE AND 10 FEET OF 0.375 WALL THICKNESS, X-52 PIPE WAS INSTALLED.  PRIOR TO INSTALLATION A HYDROSTATIC TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON THE NEW SECTION OF PIPE AT 1858 (MINIMUM) PSIG.  THE NEW PIPE WAS TIED IN TO THE EXISTING, UNAFFECTED PIPE.  THE PIPELINE WAS THEN STARTED BACK UP AT APPROXIMATELY 7PM CST ON APRIL 27, 1999.  THE AFFECTED SECTION OF PIPE WAS PULLED FROM THE CASING.  A VERY SMALL ANOMALY OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN WAS DISCOVERED.  THE SECTION OF PIPE WAS SHIPPED TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR ANALYSIS.  THE REPORT FROM KIEFNER STATED THAT THE ANOMALY APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE ELECTRICAL ARCING BETWEEN THE PIPELINE AND CASING.  APPARENTLY AN ELECTRICAL POWER LINE LOCATED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE PIPELINE CASING VENT WAS DOWNED AND MADE CONTACT WITH THE VENT PIPE, WHICH PROVIDED AN ELECTRICAL PATH FOR THE FAULT CURRENT TO TRAVEL FROM THE POWER LINE TO THE CASING, FROM WHERE THE CURRENT ARCED TO THE CARRIER PIPE.  THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE HOLE MELTED IN THE CASING VENT PIPE AND AN APPARENT SPLICE IN THE OVERHEAD POWER LINE IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE PIPELINE FURTHER SUPPORTS KIEFNERS CONCLUSIONS.  THE REPORT ALSO STATED THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT THE ELECTRICAL DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY LIGHTNING DUE TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DAMAGE.

THE ANALYSIS WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPONENTS. EXTERNAL FORCES, INTERNAL FORCES AND MATERIAL DEFECTS.  INTERNAL FORCES AND MATERIAL DEFECTS DID NOT LEAD US TO ROOT CAUSES.  ALL THE ROOT CAUSES CAME FROM EXTERNAL FORCES.  THE TEAM DETERMINED THAT THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE STRESS CREATED BY WATER CURRENT PASSING OVER THE SPANNING PIPE.  THE PIPE WAS SPANNING BECAUSE OUR INSPECTION CYCLE FREQUENCY WAS TOO LONG FOR THIS SPECIFIC LOCATION.  HIGHER THAN NORMAL TIDAL CURRENTS IN THIS AREA CAUSED LINE-LONG SPANNING PROBLEMS FASTER THAN NORMAL.  ANOTHER EXTERNAL FORCE THAT CONCERNED THE TEAM IS THIRD PARTY DAMAGE.  WE COULD NOT CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION ON THIS CAUSE DUE TO LACK OF DATA FROM A CALIPER SMART PIG INSPECTION.  TEPCOS CREWS AND CONTRACTORS WORKING IN THE VICINITY OF OUR PIPELINE DURING THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT IS A VERY COINCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT NEEDS DATA DRIVEN INVESTIGATION.

THE SPILLED MATERIAL WAS CRUDE OIL.  THE CRUDE OIL WAS CONTAINED PRIMARILY IN DRIED DRAINAGE DITCHES.  THERE WAS NO SURFACE WATER PRESENT IN THE SPILL AREA.  THE OUTSIDE OPERATOR NOTIFIED THE INSIDE OPERATOR AND INITIATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITIES.  THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED ON-SITE AND THERE WAS NO THREAT TO SURFACE WATERS.  FREE OIL RECOVERY WAS BEGUN AND TEMPORARY EARTHEN DAMS WERE CONSTRUCTED TO PREVENT FURTHER MIGRATION OF THE OIL DOWN THE DRAINAGE DITCHES.  THE INITIAL SOURCE  WAS BELIEVED TO BE AND IDLE, UNDERGROUND 10"" SPUR.  THIS LINE WAS ISOLATED.  THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT RELEASED WERE ONLY 25 BARRELS AND THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS WAS NOTIFIED.  UPON ARRIVAL OF ADDITIONAL RESPONSE CREW AND FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION, THE ESTIMATION OF AMOUNT RELEASED WAS REVISED TO 120 BARRELS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION WAS NOTIFIED AT THAT TIME.  FREE OIL RECOVERY CONTINUED AND MR. BILL LANGSTON ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 10PM TO INVESTIGATE.  AT THAT TIME, IT APPEARED THE SPILL WAS UNDER CONTROL AND BEING FULLY RECOVERED.  IN THE MORNING, DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE SOURCE WAS NOT THE IDLE 10"" LINE, BUT ANOTHER UNDERGROUND LINE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET AWAY FROM THE 10"".  THE 20"" FILL LINE FROM THE WEST TEXAS GULF LINE WAS UNCOVERED AND THE SOURCE EXPOSED.  THE SOURCE WAS A PINHOLE CAUSED FROM EXTERNAL PIT CORROSION.  CLEANUP CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE DAY, RECOVERING 580 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL. IMPACTED SOILS WERE REMOVED TO BE BIO-TREATED ONSITE.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE TNRCC AND THE RCT INSPECTED THE SITE.  MR. BARNEY GANDY OF THE RCT VERBALLY APPROVED THE SITE CLEANUPS COMPLETION.  CONFIRMATION SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED ON MARCH 16, 2000 WHICH DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SOIL WS REMEDIATED TO LESS AND 1% TOTAL PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS."

A PHILLIPS EMPLOYEE WAS DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION TO EVALUATE THE LEAK.  EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT 12:15 AM AND CONFIRMED THERE WAS A LEAK CAUSING A VAPOR CLOUD ON PHILLIPS PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY.  PHILLIPS EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL WERE SENT TO THE LOCATION.  THE BRAZORIA COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT WAS CONTACTED AND DISPATCHED AN OFFICER TO THE SITE.  PHILLIPS PERSONNEL ENTERED THE SUSPECTED LEAK AREA WITH HYDROCARBON DETECTOR AND DETERMINED THE LIMITS OF VAPOR CLOUD (USING A 10% LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT CRITERIA) WAS APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET IN RADIUS AT GROUND LEVEL.  PUBLIC EVACUATION AND ROADBLOCKS WERE NOT REQUIRED SINCE THERE WERE NO HOUSES OR PUBLIC ROADS IN THE VICINITY.  SINCE THERE WERE MULTIPLE LINES IN THIS RIGHT OF WAY INITIAL EFFORTS WERE FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING THE CORRECT LINE AND SHUTTING DOWN ANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS.  A TOTAL OF FOUR LINES WERE SHUTDOWN DURING THE PROCESS INCLUDING THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE.  A SAMPLE OF THE VAPOR WAS TAKEN AND ANALYZED AT THE SWEENY COMPLEX LABORATORY WHICH CONFIRMED THE LEAKING LINE TO BE THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE.  THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE TAKES PRODUCT FROM THE SWEENY COMPLEX TO UNDERGROUND STORAGE AT THE CLEMENS TERMINAL STORAGE FACILITY.  THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE WAS DEPRESSURIZED TO A SPHERE STORAGE TANK AT THE SWEENY COMPLEX AT APPROXIMATELY 430AM.  THIS REDUCED THE PIPELINE PRESSURE FROM APPROXIMATELY 650 PSIG DOWN TO 50 PSIG.  AT 1150 AM THE CLEMENS TERMINAL LAUNCHED A PIG TO DISPLACE THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE WITH WATER TO SWEENY COMPLEX.  IT IS ESTIMATED THE PIG PASSED THE LEAK LOCATION AT 1018PM APRIL 21, 2000.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THERE WAS NO WIND.  SCATTERED FOG WAS BEGINNING TO FORM ALONG THE PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY.  THE LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 INCHES FROM A WELD AT CLOCK LOCATION 3:30.  EXTERNAL CORROSION PITS WERE VISIBLE AT THE LEAK.  ONE AT THE 330 POSITION AND ONE AT APPROXIMATELY 3:50 POSITION.  WHEN UNCOVERING THE LEAK THERE WAS A THIN WHITE PLASTIC SHEET LOOSELY WRAPPED AROUND THE WELD AREA.  COATING MATERIAL IN THE AREA DIRECTLY AROUND THE WELD WAS NOT VISIBLE WHEN THE PLASTIC WAS REMOVED.  CATHODIC PROTECTION READINGS AT THE WELD WERE 1724 MV WHICH IS ABOVE THE -850MV CRITERIA USED ON THIS PIPELINE.  THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE LEAK IS THAT THE COMBINATION OF BAD COATING AND WATER TRAPPED UNDER THE PLASTIC RESULTED IN A CORROSION CELL.  THE WELDS APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET EAST AND WEST OF THE LEAK WERE ALSO UNCOVERED FOR INSPECTION.  THE COATING AND WRAP WERE FOUND TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION.  THE COATING WAS REMOVED AND NO INDICATION OF WATER OR EXTERNAL CORROSION WAS EVIDENT AT THESE TWO LOCATIONS.  ULTRASONIC READING ON THE PIPE INDICATED FULL WALL THICKNESS.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2000, CONOCO PIPE LINE (CPL) OIL MOVEMENTS GROUP LOCATED IN HOUSTON TEXAS, RECEIVED AN ALARM THAT INDICATED A LOW SUCTION CONDITION EXISTED AT ONE OF THE PUMP STATIONS ON THE KANSAS CITY PIPE LINE (KCPL) SYSTEM. AFTER EXAMINING THE CONTROL PARAMETERS OF TH3E SYSTEM, THE OPERATIONS COORDINATOR ATTEMPTED TO RESET THE ALARM AND RESTART THE UNIT. UNABLE TO RESTART THE UNIT, THE OPERATIONS COORDINATOR STARTED THE BACK-UP UNIT. WHEN THE CONTROL PARAMETERS FAILED TO INDICATE THE NECESSARY CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH OPERATING THE UNIT, THE LINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATED (THE ISOLATION OPERATION WAS COMPLETE BY 06:45 HRS. DECEMBER 19, 2000). SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THE ISOLATION PROCESS, EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED OF THE POTENTIAL LINE FAILURE AND DISPATCHED TO LOCATE THE POSSIBLE RELEASE. WHILE RESPONSE PERSONNEL WERE ATTEMPTING TO LOCATE THE POSSIBLE RELEASE, THE CPL OIL MOVEMENTS GROUP RECEIVED AN EMERGENCY PHONE CALL AT 07:05 HRS. FROM A PASSERBY NEAR EUREKA, KS. THE CALLER REPORTED GASOLINE RUNNING IN A BARROW DITCH ALONG COUNTY RD 14 IN GREENWOOD COUNTY, KS. RESPONSE PERSONNEL WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA, WHERE THEY FURTHER ISOLATED THE FAILURE POINT, VIA MANUALLY OPERATED BLOCK VALVES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RELEASE. CONTAINMENT AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS WERE UNDERWAY BY 08:15.THE INITIAL AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS TO THE NRC AND KDHE WERE MADE AT 09:20 HRS. AND 09:30 HRS. ON DECEMBER 19TH, 2000 RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, THE CENTRAL REGION OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY WAS NOTIFIED AS A COURTESY AT 09:35 HRS ON THAT SAME DAY. THE RELEASE VOLUME REPORTED DURING THESE INITIAL AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS, WAS 50 TO 100BBLS. AS THE RECOVERY PROCESS PROGRESSED, IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT MORE PRODUCT HAD BEEN RELEASED THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE QUANTITY OF PRODUCT BEING RECOVERED, AS WELL AS BY THE VOLUMES REQUIRED TO REPACK THE PIPELINE SYSTEM AFTER REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED. THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF RELEASE PRODUCT WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE FIRST RESPONDERS VISUAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE RELEASE SITE. UNFORTUNATELY THE RELEASE OCCURED DURING A HEAVY SNOWFALL, AND IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT THE SNOWFALL HAMPERED THE FIRST RESPONDERS ABILITY TO SEE PRODUCT THAT HAD MIGRATED BENEATH THE SNOW. THE RELEASE VOLUME IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 2090 BBLS. AN ADDITIONAL CALL WAS MADE TO THE CENTRAL REGION OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY ON JANUARY 3, 2001 @ 09:45 TO UPDATE THEM AS TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATED VOLUME FOR THE RELEASE. ADDITIONALLY, THIS INFORMATION WAS PASSED ON TO THE KDHE. WITH REGARD TO THE FAILURE, A FULL RCFA IS UNDERWAY. HOWEVER, PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED DUE TO STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEAT AFFECTED ZONE OF AN OLD PATCH TYPE REPAIR (THE PATCH WAS LOCATED IN AN UNDER-BEND AT A ROAD CROSSING). THE PATCH WAS APPROXIMATELY 12"" LONG AND 8"" WIDE AND WAS INSTALLED PRIOR TO CPL OPERATING THE PIPELINE SYSTEM. WITH REGARD TO THE REPAIR, CPL MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL REPLACED APPROXIMATELY 180 FEET OF 10"" PIPE. THIS FOOTAGE WAS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE TIE IN LOCATIONS WERE A SUFFICIENTLY SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE AREA OF IMPACTED SOIL."

HE REPORTED THE SHEEN TO THE DOLLY VARDEN PLATFORM AND STOPPED TO PICK UP THE PRODUCTION FOREMAN FOR AN OVERFLIGHT. THE SHEEN WAS A VERY WHITE MILKY COLOR, 2 MILES LONG X 1/2 MILE WIDE STREAMERS, 1/4 OF THE AREA WAS SHEEN. IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THE GAS PIPELINE WAS LEAKING DUE TO THE COLOR, SO NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE NRC (REPORT #555851). THE GAS LINE WAS SHUT IN, FILLED WITH FILTERED WATER AND HYDROTESTED TO 600+PSIG, WHICH PROVED THE GAS LINE TO BE INTACT. THE SHEEN DISAPPEARED DUE TO TIDES. THE OIL PIPELINE WAS NEXT SHUT IN TO HYDROTEST TO PROVE OR DISPROVE IF IT HAD A LEAK. A POLY PIG WAS SHIPPED AHEAD OF THE FILTERED WATER, DISPLACING THE OIL, BUT A GOOD HYDROTEST COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED. IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THE PRESSURE FLUCTUATION COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO RESIDUAL OIL/GAS REMAINING IN THE PIPELINE AND COMPRESSING OR DUE TO TEMPERATURE VARIATION. A CUP PIG WAS NEXT SHIPPED TO ENSURE THAT NO OIL REMAINED IN THE PIPELINE. THE SECOND HYDROTEST ATTEMPT INDICATED THAT THE OIL LINE HAD A LEAK. DUE TO THE BLACKWATER NATURE OF THE COOK INLET WATERS, GAS WAS THEN USED TO DISPLACE THE WATER TO ALLOW DIVERS TO FIND THE LEAK LOCATION BY FOLLOWING THE BUBBLES. AFTER SERVERAL DIVES, THE DIVERS FOUND A 1/4 INCH HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPELINE. OTHER THAN THE INITIAL SHEEN OBSERVED BY THE PILOT, NO OTHER SPILL INDICATIONS WERE OBSERVED. DIVING CEASED DUE TO DANGER FROM PAN ICE IN THE INLET TO THE DIVE BOAT AND DIVERS. AT THE PRESENT, GAS PRESSURE IS BEING MAINTAINED ON THE LINE TO MINIMIZE WATER INTRUSION INTO THE PIPELINE AND TO PREVENT FREEZE-UP AT THE ONSHORE CROSSING. DIVING INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE MODE OF FAILURE WILL RESUME WHEN THE ICE IS OUT OF THE INLET."

ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE OIL WAS CONTAINED TO CHICAP PROPERTY, A SMALL AMOUNT OF OIL (LESS THAN 1 BBL) WAS ABLE TO UNDERFLOW THE DITCH PLUG AND GET INTO A CULVERT THAT LEADS OFF THE PROPERTY. THIS OIL ENTERED A DRY DRAINAGE CHANNEL AND FLOWED FOR APPROXIMATELY 120 FEET. AT 11:47 PM, THE CONTROL CENTER EMPLOYEE BEGAN MAKING INTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS, INCLUDING TO THE SUPERVISOR JIM EAGLETON. AT 12:05 AM, JIM EAGLETON ARRIVED AT PATOKA AND ASSUMED COMMAND OF THE INCIDENT AND BEGAN MAKING NOTIFICATIONS, INCLUDING TO THE PATOKA FIRE DEPARTMENT, TO FOLTZ CONSTRUCTION (A LOCAL RESPONSE CONTRACTOR), TO 911, TO THE AFFECTED LANDOWNER, AND TO PATRICK ARMSTRONG, THE DISTRICT MANAGER. AT 12:40, PATRICK ARMSTRONG ARRIVES AT THE MOKENA OFFICE AND BEGINS MAKING ADDITIONAL NOTIFICATIONS, INCLUDING TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, TO THE ILLINOIS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, TO THE UNOCAL PIPELINE GENERAL MANAGER, AND TO TWO RESPONSE CONTRACTORS, ERST-OBRIENS AND HERITAGE ENVIRONMENTAL. AT APPROXIMATELY 1:00AM (MAY 3), FOLTZ CONSTRUCTION CREWS ARRIVED AT PATOKA AND BEGAN RECOVERING THE CRUDE OIL WITH A VACUUM TRUCK. RECOVERY CONTINUED UNTIL 5:00 AM, WHEN ALL OF THE RECOVERABLE OIL HAD BEEN PICKED UP. AT 5:00 AM, EXCAVATION BEGAN IN THE MANIFOLD AREA NEAR THE SITE OF THE LEAK. AT 7:00 AM, PATRICK ARMSTRONG AND BRIAN BURNS ARRIVED ON SITE AND ASSUMED THE ROLES OF INCIDENT COMMANDER AND SAFETY OFFICER, RESPECTIVELY. THE SITUATION WAS SIZED UP AND A DECISION WAS MADE TO MOBILIZE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO WORK ON THE CLEANUP. A CREW FROM HERTAGE ENVIRONMENTAL WAS MOBILIZED FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY. AT 1:00 PM, ADDITIONAL OVERFLOW DAMS WERE INSTALLED IN THE DRAINAGE DITCH ALONG DICKEY POND ROAD, DOWNSTREAM OF THE AFFECTED AREA, TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER MIGRATION OF OIL IN THE EVENT OF RAIN. BY 5:15 PM ( MAY 3), AFTER 12 HOURS OF EXCAVATION IN THE MANIFOLD AREA, THE STRAINER WAS LIFTED OUT OF THE MANIFOLD BY CRANE, AND WAS EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF THE FAILURE. AT THAT TIME, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THERE IS A 1/4"" BY 1"" HOLE IN THE 2"" DRAIN LINE AT A POINT JUST BELOW THE WELD THAT FASTENS THE DRAIN LINE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STRAINER. A DECISION WAS MADE TO TEMPORARILY REPLACE THE STRAINER WITH A 26"" FLANGED SPOOL PIECE. RECOVERY CONTINUED IN THE MANIFOLD DURING THE DAY AND ANOTHER 30 BARRELS OF OIL AND WATER IS COVERED. AT 5:30 PM (MAY 3), THE HERITAGE ENVIRONMENTAL CREW ARRIVED AND BEGAN CLEANUP OF THE OFFSITE AREA AND EXCAVATION OF THE DRAINAGE DITCH. CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS STOCKPILED ON VISQUEEN IN THE TANK 1 BASIN. CLEANUP OF THE DRAINAGE DITCH CONTINUED ALL OF THE NEXT DAY (MAY 4). AT 9:00 AM (MAY 4), TOM POWELL WITH ILLINOIS EPA EMERGENCY RESPONSE GROUP, TOURED THE SITE AND DISCUSSED CLEANUP OBJECTIVES. AT 8:00 PM (MAY 4), THE TEMPORARY FLANGED SPOOL WAS INSTALLED IN PLACE OF THE STRAINER AND THE CHICAP PIPELINE WAS RE-STARTED. CLEANUP CONTINUED ALL DAY ON MAY 5; BY THE END OF THE DAY, ALL OF THE DRAINAGE DITCH AREAS HAD BEEN EXCAVATED AND STOCKPILED, AND ALL CULVERTS HAD BEEN PRESSURE WASHED CLEAN. SOIL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN IN THE DRAINAGE DITCHES ON MAY 8TH, AND ARE BEING TESTED TO DETERMINE IF IEPA CLEANUP OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN MET. CLEANUP IN THE MANIFOLD AREA IS PROCEEDING WITH A SUPER SUCKER. PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR LONG TERM IN-SITU REMEDIATION IN THIS AREA. INVESTIGATION OF THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK, AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO PREVENT RE-OCCURRENCE ARE ON-GOING."

THE SPILL WAS A RESULT OF OVERFILLING AN 80,000 BBL. TRANSMIX TANK, T-421. BACKGROUND: THE OPERATOR ON SHIFT WAS RECEIVING TMIX FROM MARATHON PIPELINE INTO TANK 421. THAT RECEIPT WAS FOLLOWED BY A RECEIPT OF TMIX FROM EXPLORER PIPELINE THAT ALSO WENT INTO TANK 421. ADDITIONALLY, THAT RECEIPT WAS FOLLOWED BY A DELIVERY FROM EXPLORER PIPELINE OF RFG GASOLINE INTO TANK 411. DUE TO A VALVE BEING TEMPORARILY OUT OF SERVICE FOR MAINTENANCE IN THE EXPLORER MAINIFOLD, AN ALTERNATE VALVE LINE UP WAS REQUIRED TO RECEIVE RFG INTO TANK 411. THE ALTERNATE VALVE LINE UP REQUIRED THE UTILIZATION OF THE OIL SIDE OF THE EXPLORER MANIFOLD VIA THE TANK 410 RECEIPT LINE. THIS PARTICULAR VALVE LINE UP PROVIDES A CONNECTION TO THE TANK 421 RECEIPT LINE VIA THE CPL MAINFOLD. (SIMILAR LINE UPS HAVE BEEN USED ON PAST RECEIPTS WITH NO PROBLEMS) WHEN THIS OUT OF ORDINARY LINE UP WAS EXECUTED, VALVE TM 407 WAS IN THE OPEN POSITION. THIS VALVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED TO PREVENT RFG FROM CROSSING OVER FROM THE TANK 410 RECEIPT LINE TO THE TANK 421 RECEIPT LINE, WHICH IS NORMALLY LINED UP FOR PUMPING THE CPL SUMP. VALVE TM 407 WAS NOT LISTED ON THE VALVE LINE-UP SHEETS. BECAUSE THIS VALVE (NOT LISTED ON THE VALVE LINE UP SHEET) WAS OPEN, RFG GASOLINE WAS ALLOWED TO STRIP INTO TANK 421. CONSEQUENTLY, THE HIGH LEVEL ALARM FOR TANK 421 ACTIVATED AT APPROXIMATELY 04:24 HRS. AS A RESULT OF THIS ALARM, THE OPERATOR ON DUTY CLIMBED AND GAUGED TANK 421 TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE ALARM. THE OPERATOR ASSUMED THAT THE ALARM WAS THE RESULT OF THE ORIGINAL DELIVERY INTO TANK 421, AS THE RECEIPT VALVE FOR THIS TANK HAD BEEN CLOSED AT THE MANIFOLD. THE OPERATOR TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION UNTIL OBSERVING THE TANK IN AN OVERFILL CONDITION. UPON FINDING THE TANK IN AN OVERFILL CONDITION, THE OPERATOR NOW ASSISTED BY THE FACILITY MANAGER, LOCATED AND CLOSED VALVE TM 407 ISOLATING TANK 421 FROM THE INCOMING STREAM INTENDED TO FILL TANK 411. FORTUNATELY, THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED INSIDE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT, AND WAS RECOVERED QUICKLY WITH THE USE OF A VACUUM TRUCK FROM THE LOCAL OSRO. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF RFG INADVERTENTLY DELIVERED INTO TANK 421 WAS 2905 BBLS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TRANSMIX THAT SPILLED INTO THE DIKE WAS APPROXIMATELY 150 BBLS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TRANSMIX RECOVERED WAS 122 BBLS.CONCLUSION: THE OPERATOR ON DUTY DID NOT FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURE WHEN PREPARING FOR OR EXECUTING A VALVE LINE UP. THIS VIOLATION OF PROCEDURE RESULTED IN THE UNINTENTIONAL CONTINUED MOVEMENT OF PRODUCT INTO TANK 421, RESULTING IN THE OVERFILL CONDITION."

THE CAUSE OF THE PINHOLE WAS EXTERNAL CORROSION.  APPROXIMATELY 100 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL DISCHARGED ONTO THE GROUND WATER LOCATED IN CYPRESS BAYOU.  AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY  1 1/2 MILE WAS CONTAMINATED.  THE CONTAMINATION RANGED IN COLOR FROM BLACK TO BROWN TO RAINBOW SHEENING.  CLOSING THE FLAP GATES LOCATED ON THE DRAINING PIPES CONTAINED THE SPILL.  IN THE 1 1/2 AREA OF CONTAMINATION THERE WERE TWO SUCH FLAP GATE AREAS.  TO ASSIST IN CONTROLLING THE PIPELINE SEEPAGE FROM THE PINHOLE, CLEPCO PERSONNEL CLOSED THE SCRAPER TRAP PLUG VALVES; THUS, ISOLATING THE AFFECTED LINE SEGMENT FROM THE MAINLINE.  IN ADDITION, INSTALLING A LEAK CLAMP OVER THE PINHOLE LEAK PERFORMED A TEMPORARY REPAIR.  AFTER THE SPILL AREA WAS EVALUATED AND SURVEYED BY CLEPCO, LADEQ, AND THE LOUISIANA STATE POLICE THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM WAS UTILIZED BY ALL RESPONDERS TO DEVISE AND DEVELOP A RESPONSE PLAN.  THE INITIAL CLEANUP INVOLVED REMOVING THE THICK BLACK COLORED LIQUID CRUDE THAT HAD GATHERED AT THE 1ST DUMP FLAP GATE SITE BY USING VACUUM TRUCKS.  TO ASSIST IN THE CLEANUP OF THE BAYOU CONTAMINATION, AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, A PROFESSIONAL CLEANUP CREW ARRIVED ON SITE @ 4:30 PM ON 8-16-01.  UPON THEIR ARRIVAL, EACH DUMP GATE LOCATION WAS SECURED BY ADDING FLOATATION BOOMS IN FRONT OF THE DUMPS TO HELP CONTAIN, HOLD, AND DIRECT THE MIGRATING CRUDE TO THE VACUUM TRUCKS FROM REMOVAL.  WASH DOWN PUMPS WAS DEPLOYED AT THE UPPERMOST POINT OF CONTAMINATION AND BEGAN MOVING THE SPILL TO THE 1ST DUMP FOR RETRIEVAL.  BY THE END OF THE FIRST DAY, APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE CONTAMINATION WAS REMOVED USING THE ABOVE PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT.  IN DAY TWO (8-17-01) OF THE INCIDENT, RESPONDERS USED THE SAME TECHNIQUES AS DAY ONE.  THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS THAT THE SCOPE OF THE CLEANUP SHIFTED FROM DUMP #1 TO STAGING AREA #1 WHICH WAS ABOUT HALF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN DUMP #1 AND DUMP #2.  STAGING AREA #1 WAS A MINI-BOOM LOCATION SUPPLEMENTED BY A VACUUM TRUCK AND RETRIEVAL PERSONNEL.  AT THE END OF DAY TWO, APPROXIMATELY 25% THE SPILL WAS RETRIEVED.  DAY THREE (8-18-01) AN ADDITIONAL CLEANUP CONTRACTOR, PETRON, WAS ADDED TO THE EXISTING CLEANUP CREWS TO ASSIST IN THE CLEANUP EFFORT.  PETRON AND AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINUED TO UTILIZE THE SAME STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES AS DAY ONE AND DAY TWO.  THE DRAGGING OF MINI-BOOMS AND ABSORBENT BOOMS ON DAY THREE WAS EFFECTIVE WHEN THE CRUDE BECAME FRACTURED AND HEAVY DUE TO RAINFALL.  AT THE END OF DAY THREE, 90% OF THE CRUDE OIL SPILLED WAS RETRIEVED.  AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES WAS RELEASED.  8-19-01 PETRON AND CLEPCO PERSONNEL CONTINUED THE CLEANUP USING ABSORBENTS AND THE WASH DOWN OF RESIDUALS.  PETRON SPRAYED THE AREA WITH HAZCLEAN E-R TO ASSIST IN THE CLEANING OF AFFECTED VEGETATION.  THE ESTIMATED 90 BARRELS OF LIQUID CRUDE THAT WAS RECOVERED BY VACUUM TRUCK WAS REINJECTED INTO CLEPCOS PIPELINE SYSTEM @ CLEPCOS SEARCY STATION.  TESTS ARE PRESENTLY BEING PLANNED ON  THE WASTE BEFORE IT MAY BE SUBMITTED FOR DISPOSAL.  LADEQ WILL BE MAILED A COPY OF THE WASTE DISPOSAL MANIFEST.  AT PRESENT, WE PLAN TO MONITOR THE SITE ON A DAILY BASIS FOR SEVERAL DAYS.  ANY RESIDUE THAT APPEARS AT THE TWO BOOM SITES WILL BE PROMPTLY REMOVED.  JASON DEWITT, LADEQ, IS PRESENTLY ASSISTING IN THE DAILY MONITORING AND RESIDUAL CLEANUP.  A FINAL INSPECTION BY LADEQ IS PLANNED LATER IN THE WEEK."

UPON ARRIVAL AT THE TERMINAL, THE PIPELINE TECHNICIAN FOUND GASOLINE SPRAYING FROM THE FLANGE ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE SURGE RELIEF VALVE.  THE SURGE RELIEF LINE HAD MOVED OFF THE SUPPORTS AND WAS SAGGING, APPARENTLY DUE TO HYDRAULIC HAMMER.  THE WEIGHT OF THE SAGGING LINE APPARENTLY CAUSED THE FLANGE TO SPREAD SLIGHTLY ALLOWING PRODUCT TO LEAK OUT.

AN ESTIMATED 2,000 GALLONS OF 87RF GASOLINE WAS RELEASED FROM THE FLANGE SPILLLING ONTO THE GROUND AROUND THE MANIFOLD WITH A SMALL QUANTITY ENTERING THE PASSAIC RIVER.  INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT SHOWS THAT THE DELIVERY CONTROL VALVE AT NEWARK SUNOCO HAD LOST ITS SET-POINT CONTROL LOOP DURING A POWER FAILURE THE NIGHT BEFORE DURING AN AREA-WIDE POWER OUTAGE.  AT THE TIME THE TERMINAL SWITCH WAS TO ME MADE, INFORMATION RECEIVED AT THE CONTROL CENTER INDICATED THAT THERE WAS AN OPEN PATH INTO THE NORMAL DELIVERY TANK.

SHERIFF AND LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND BEGAN EVACUATION OF THE HOUSES SURROUNDING THE LEAK SITE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HYDROCARBON VAPOR IN THE AREA.  SWEENY COMPLEX EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND BEGAN ASSISTING WITH THE EVACUATION OF THE PUBLIC AROUND THE SITE AND ESTABLISHING A SAFE PERIMETER AROUND THE AREA.  TWO ROADS AROUND THE AREA WERE BLOCKED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL.  AN EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTER WAS ACTIVATED AT THE SWEENY COMPLEX AND ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE.  A LOCAL COMMUNITY CENTER WAS OPENED FOR DISPLACED RESIDENTS IN THE AREA AND HOTEL ROOMS WERE PROVIDED FOR THOSE AFFECTED.  SINCE THERE WERE MULTIPLE LINES IN THIS RIGHT OF WAY INITIAL EFFORTS WERE FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING THE CORRECT LINE AND SHUTTING DOWN ANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS.  A TOTAL OF 10 LINES WERE SHUTDOWN DURING THIS PROCESS INCLUDING THE #9 PROPYLENE PIPELINE.  ALL OF THESE PIPELINES TAKE PRODUCT FROM THE SWEENY COMPLEX TO UNDERGROUND STORAGE AT THE CLEMENS TERMINAL STORAGE FACILITY.  DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF VAPOR COMING FROM THE LEAK PERSONNEL WERE NOT ABLE TO SAFELY GET INTO THE IMMEDIATE AREA SURROUNDING THE LEAK TO TAKE A SAMPLE OR STOP THE LEAK AT THE SOURCE OF THE VAPOR.  THE PROPYLENE  LINE WAS SUSPECTED TO BE THE LEAKING LINE DUE TO THE PRESSURE DROP SEEN ON THE LINE.  ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO ROUTE THE PROPYLENE TO EXISTING FLARES ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SYSTEM.  THE LINE DEPRESSURED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE LEAK SITE AND TO THE FLARES AT BOTH UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 11:50PM ON OCTOBER 15, 2001 WHEN THE LINE EMPTIED OF VAPORS.  MONITORING OF THE AREA SURROUNDING THE LEAK CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.  THE ROADBLOCKS WERE RELEASED THE NEXT DAY. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THERE WAS LIGHT WINDS.  THE WIND SHIFTED DURING THE NIGHT WHEN A FRONT CAME INTO THE AREA.  MONITORING OF VAPORS WAS ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY DURING THE NIGHT.  THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS PREVIOUS EXTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE.  THE LEAK AT THE SITE CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY A 12"" SPLIT WHICH STARTED AT A WELD AT CLOCK LOCATION OF 2:00.  EVIDENCE OF THE EXTERNAL DAMAGE WAS EVIDENT ON THE PIPE.  A DENT WAS PRESENT AT THE APPARENT START OF THE SPLIT AND SCRAP MARKS WERE FOUND ALONG THE TOP OF THE PIPE AND IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLIT.  A 4 FEET SECTION OF PIPE ALONG THE TOP OF THE PIPE WAS FLATTENED.  THE COATING ON THE PIPE WAS SCRAPED OFF WITH NO EVIDENCE OF HAVING BEEN REPAIRED.  THE PIPE UNDER THE COATING SHOWED LITTLE TO NO EVIDENCE OF CORROSION.  CATHODIC PROTECTION READINGS AT THE LEAK SITE WERE -1323 M V WHICH IS ABOVE THE -850MV CRITERIA USED ON THIS PIPELINE.  DIRECTLY UNDER THIS LINE WAS A CROSSING LINE WHICH HAD BEEN LAID IN 1997.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE OTHER CAUSES CONTRIBUTING TO THE RELEASE.  PRIOR TO THE START OF THE LEAK A LINE UP HAD OCCURRED WHICH PUT A HIGHER THAN NORMAL PRESSURE ON THE LINE.  ALTHOUGH THE PRESSURE WAS BELOW THE MOP OF THE LINE IT WAS ABOVE THE PRESSURE NORMALLY SEEN ON THE LINE.  AS A PRECAUTION THE LINES WHICH HAD BEEN CROSSED BY THE LINE LAID IN 1997 WERE EXCAVATED TO CHECK FOR DAMAGE.  THREE LINES IN THE CORRIDOR SHOWED COATING DAMAGE AT THE CROSSING LOCATION.  ONE UNREGULATED NITROGEN LINE SHOWED A SMALL GOUGE ON THE LINE WHICH WAS EVALUATED NOT TO COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE LINE.  METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED PIPE IS BEING PERFORMED.  A 20 FEET SECTION OF THE LINE WAS INSTALLED AT THE LEAK LOCATION TO REPLACE TO FAILED PIPE.  PIPELINE WAS PUT BACK IN SERVICE ON OCTOBER 19, 2001. UPDATE 3-28-02 BASED ON HIS FINDINGS WE BELIEVE THAT THE OVERHELMING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE PRESENT ON THE PIPE SECTION WOULD MAKE FURTHER METALLURICAL ANALYSIS OF LIMITED VALUE.  THE PIPE SECTION HAD AND INWARD DENT PRESENT AT THE START OF THE SPLIT, SCRAP MARKS ALONG AND PAST THE SPLIT, AND APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET OF FLATTENED"
