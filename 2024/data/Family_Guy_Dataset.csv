Peter begins behaving as if he were a redneck, eventually painting over the entire rear window of his pickup, which results in him reversing the car into his neighbor Quagmire's car. After destroying the car, Peter drives Quagmire to the airport, as he is due to fly an airplane. While at the airport, Peter steals the fuel used for Quagmire's airplane, naively believing it will make his pickup fly, resulting in Quagmire's plane crashing safely shortly after, due to a lack of fuel. As a result, Quagmire loses his job and is forced to live with the Griffins until he can find another place to work. Peter claims he is no longer going to be a redneck, although this fails to comfort Quagmire over his loss. The group then sets out to get Quagmire his job back by incapacitating the pilots of another plane, causing it to need to be rescued by Quagmire, making him a town hero. The plan backfires, however, as Quagmire does not get on the plane in time. Quagmire eventually contacts Peter, Cleveland and Joe via air traffic control and instructs Peter on landing the plane safely. The plan succeeded and Quagmire got his job back, even though Peter took responsibility for hijacking accusations."

Out of options, Brian time-travels back to just before Stewie finished the machine and explains it was a prank by playing Chris's video backwards, showing him eating the Rubik's Cube.

This prompts the others to recall their own first love experiences. Spoofing Cast Away, Quagmire envisions himself as a FedEx delivery guy who is engaged to Helen Hunt. Three days before their wedding, he crash lands on a deserted island after his plane is hit by lightning, and starts to go insane after being stranded for four years. Alongside his friend, a volleyball named after Rita Wilson, Quagmire braves another storm and even Somali pirates from Captain Phillips in order to arrive back home, only to discover that Helen has moved on and married Paul Reiser while mentioning about a Mad About You reboot on Spectrum Originals. A heartbroken Quagmire walks off into the rain, but gets over the breakup after discovering portable porn. After the story, Peter, Cleveland, and Joe can't find the reboot in question on Spectrum Originals. Joe goes next with his first love experience story. Parodying Dirty Dancing, Joe recalls being a dance instructor at a camp, who catches the eye of Jennifer Schnozz; he ends up recruiting her as his new partner after Dancy McGee comes down with TMJ and has to undergo an illegal jaw surgery. Despite falling in love, Joe and Jennifer are barred form seeing each other by Dr. Hartman after he blames Joe for Dancy's botched surgery. Nonetheless, Joe stands up to him and dances with Jennifer at the camp talent show, but not before she too has to get a jaw surgery after he gets her pregnant. When Peter and Cleveland try to tell their love experience story, Joe allows Peter to tell his love experience story. Peter thinks back to 1989 where he falls in love with Meg Ryan after seeing her in When Harry Met Sally.... After seeing more of her movies, he bears witness to Ryan breaking the fourth wall and yanking him into the screen. Upon becoming friends, Peter follows her through many of her iconic movies and shows, taking up the roles of various male characters, before they profess their love during In the Cut. However, the whole story turns out to be a dream as Peter has just fallen asleep in the theater while masturbating where he was awoken by two police officers. Back in the present, Cleveland asks if he can tell his own first love story after being pressured to by Donna. When Peter won't let him, the guys instead try to pretend he's telling the story, Donna is shown at the bar where she does not buy it as she does not see the flashback effects."
