## #30DaysChartChallenge

## <mark> What is #30DaysChartChallenge? </mark>

> The **#30DayChartChallenge** is an annual community-driven event that takes place throughout the month of April. Each day, participants are prompted to create a visualization related to one of five categories: comparisons, distributions, relationships, time series, and uncertainties. Everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of the data source or tool used to create the visualizations.
